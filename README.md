Sorrentum is an open-source Web3 / DeFi protocol to build advanced financial
applications using machine learning.

# Welcome

Hello!

Nice to meet you.

We are very happy that you are interested in the
[Sorrentum Project](https://www.sorrentum.org/)!

The project aims to combine open-source development, startups, and brilliant
students. We’ve seen this mixture of ingredients work exceptionally well at
Stanford / Berkeley / MIT / etc, where every student seems to be trying to start
a company on the side. Our goal is to bootstrap the same virtuous cycle outside
Silicon Valley so that instead of just looking for a job, you create your own.
We are still figuring out things as we go, and we are working with University of
Maryland and other interested parties to provide internships, research
assistantships, and development grants.

Besides the immediate financial benefit, this is a unique opportunity for you
to:

- Work on cutting-edge problems on machine learning and Web3
- Learn about startups and how to start your own project
- Write academic papers
- Get internships and full-time positions at companies working on Sorrentum
  applications or from our network

Most importantly, this is a unique way to be part of a community of individuals
interested in building innovative products.

# Commitment to contribute

This is our only request to you.

We understand that due to your commitments (e.g., classes, life), you might not
be able to work on Sorrentum consistently. That’s ok. At the same time, please
be aware that taking on a task means that:

1. The same task might not be available to your colleagues; and

2. We spend time helping, training, and mentoring you. So the energy we put into
   helping you will be taken away from your colleagues. If you drop out of the
   project, our effort could have been used for other teammates that committed
   more firmly to making progress

In other words, if you are not sure you can commit a meaningful amount of time
to Sorrentum (e.g., 20 hours / week), it is wise to wait to be sure you can do
it. If you are excited and want to start, go for it, do your best, and we’ll
make this experience the best possible for you.
