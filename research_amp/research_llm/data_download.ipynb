The Charles Schwab Active Trader Pulse Survey showed that active traders that have not changed strategies due to delta are leaning toward increasing their cash exposure and decreasing overall equities exposure. If Fed Chair Powell taps the brakes on the Fed’s plans over tapering, that could be the catalyst to take prices above the $1800 level. The price of Bitcoin could break above the $50,000 level next week if Fed Chair Powell decides he wants to slow up the Fed’s plans on tapering.

Most importantly, cryptocurrency exchanges have conformed to the regulatory demands of their specific industry.

The filing revealed that the fund is dubbed “FS NYDIG BITCOIN FUND I” and also that Wells Fargo Clearing Services will handle servicing and placement fees for clients. Just like Wells Fargo, JPMorgan is restricting access to wealthy clients and is also collaborating with the NYDIG.
