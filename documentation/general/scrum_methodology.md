# Roles

## Goal of Scrum methodology

- Work in the interests of customers and stakeholders to turn the vision into a
  working product

## Metaphor for the roles in terms of a race car

- ProductOwner = driver
- DevTeam = engine
- ScrumMaster = lubricants and sensors

## ScrumMaster

- Identify when the team is not performing to its ability
- Assist in correcting the issues
- Notice non-verbal cues
- Is comfortable with conflict
- Can build trust and earn respect

## ProductOwner

- Represent the customers
- Point the car in the correct direction
- Adjust the car direction to stay on course
- Make decisions about official release
- Ultimately he is responsible for success or failure of the projects
- Decide:
  - What is developed
  - When it is developed
  - Whether the product meets expectations

## DevTeam

- Aka Team, Development team, Core team
- Developers, testers, architects, designers
  - Cross-functionality is a good thing
- The ideal team size is 6 plus / minus 2

# Artifacts

## Product backlog

- = master list of all features and functionalities needed to implement the
  vision into the product

- The ProductOwner keeps the backlog:
  - Prioritized
  - Up to date
  - Clear

- The backlog is never complete:
  - Items are added and removed
  - Reordered based on priority, value, or risk

## Product backlog items

- Aka PBI
- E.g., bugs, features, enhancements, non-functional requirements

## Complexity of PBI

- ProductOwner and the DevTeam estimate the size of each task
- The complexity of each task can be expressed in different ways:
  - Points
  - T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL)

## High-priority vs lower-priority tasks

- High-priority stories should be small and clear
  - So they can be brought into the sprint

- Lower-priority items can be large and fuzzy
  - Bigger stories are decomposed into smaller chunks

## Sprint backlog

- = output of the planning meeting
- List of tasks that need to complete during the sprint

- Sprint backlog tasks have an estimate in hours

- The DevTeam keeps the sprint backlog up to date

- During a sprint
  - New tasks are discovered
  - Tasks are adjusted (in terms of description or estimated hours)
  - Tasks are marked as done

## The burndown

- Communicate how much work is remaining and what is the team velocity
- It is updated at the end of each day
- Plot the number of hours remaining (y-axis) against the number of days
  remaining (x-axis)

# The meetings

## Planning meeting

- Each sprint begins with a sprint planning attended by the team, ScrumMaster,
  ProductOwner
  - Typically one needs two hours per number of weeks to plan the sprint
  - For a 1-month sprint, 8 hours of meeting
  - For 2-week sprint, 4 hours of meeting

## Part one of sprint planning meeting

- Review of potential product backlog items for the sprint
- ProductOwner describes what the goal of the meeting is
- DevTeam asks questions to drive away ambiguity
- Outcome is one-sentence description of the desired outcome of the sprint

## Part two of sprint planning meeting

- Many DevTeams discuss how to implement the tasks
- The ProductOwner doesn't need to be present
- The ScrumMaster can be present facilitating the process

- The DevTeam discusses and decides the implementation of the tasks
- Decompose backlog items into work tasks
- Estimate tasks in terms of hours

## Daily scrum

- Aka daily stand-up
- Give the DevTeam the opportunity to sync daily, at the same time, and at the
  same place

## Daily scrum: questions

- The 3 most frequent questions are:

  1. What have you accomplished since the last meeting?
  2. What will you accomplish today?
  3. What obstacles are in your way?

## What the daily scrum is not

- The daily scrum is not a deep-dive problem-solving meeting
  - Any other issues need to be taken offline
- It is not a status report meeting to the ScrumMaster
  - The purpose is for the DevTeam members to talk to each other
- The ProductOwner is in "listen-only" mode

## Sprint review

- On the last day of the sprint, the DevTeam holds a sprint review
- Everybody should join
  - ScrumMaster
  - ProductOwner
  - DevTeam
  - Customers, key stakeholders
  - Executives

- DevTeam
  - Recaps the goal of the sprint
  - Presents the work done
- Customers
  - Review the progress made on the project
  - Accept changes
  - Ask for changes

## Sprint retrospective

- After the sprint review, the retrospective is a way to identify how to improve
  process and execution

## Sprint retrospective: questions

- What went well during the sprint?
- What could be improved in the next sprint?
