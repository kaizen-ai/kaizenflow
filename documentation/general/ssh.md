# What is SSH?

From the Wikipedia

> Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network
> services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Typical applications include
> remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network
> service can be secured with SSH.

# How we use ssh in our company?

- We use it to connect to any of our servers.
- Sometimes we use `scp` to copy files between hosts via `ssh`.

# Public key for authorization?

- We use `public key` authorization. This is the common way of secure
  authorization for SSH connection.
- GitHub also can authorize you with `public key`, if you setup it in your GH
  account. This is mean that you don't have to type your `login` and `password`
  when you interact with GitHub via `git` e.g. `git clone`, `git pull`, etc.
