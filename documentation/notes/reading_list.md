- Let's keep this reading list short (e.g., one / two books per topic) with
  really the best of the best

# Coding

- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)
    - Aka the Black Book
    - Reading and (really) understanding this is equivalent to accumulate 20
      years of coding
    - It will change your life

- [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code)
    - We should probably listen to the guy that started StackOverflow
    - Today the 12 steps are obvious, but in 2000 these simple ideas were
      revolutionary
    - And, yes you are correct noticing that Joel is holding the table tennis
      racquet incorrectly in the picture

# Data analysis

- [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662)
    - Reading is not enough: you should have tried *all* the examples of the book
    - Remember: whatever you want to do, there is a more effective pandas way to
      do it in one line
