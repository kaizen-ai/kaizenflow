#  `Cat` is the search category which can be found at https://github.com/pat310/google-trends-api/wiki/Google-Trends-Categories. Category 0 means no category filter.
#
#  `Geo` is  search country abbreviation which follows the ISO-3166 country code naming scheme, e.g. 'US' or 'US-AL' for Alabama state. Defaults to 'World'.
#
#  `Gprop` describes what Google property to filter to. Can be `images`, `news`, `youtube` or `froogle`.

# Google Trends normalizes search data to make comparisons between terms easier. Search results are normalized to the time and location of a query by the following process:
#
# - Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity. Otherwise, places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.
#
# - The resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topicâ€™s proportion to all searches on all topics.
#
# - Different regions that show the same search interest for a term don't always have the same total search volumes.
