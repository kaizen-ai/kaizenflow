# Choose a crypto wallet type

- Https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/crypto-wallet-types-explained
- Https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/types-of-crypto-wallets-explained/

## Public / private keys

See the explanation
[here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/public-private-keys-cryptography)

TLDR:

- Send a public key to receive a transaction, see it as a wallet address
- Private key is needed to prove ownership or spend the funds associated with
  your public address, see it as a password

## What do people in the team use

### Beginner

Mobile / desktop hot wallet [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/)

Pros:

- Easy to set up
- Has a mobile app which is easy to use
- Built-in exchange (e.g., allows to exchange BTC to ETH inside the app)
- Allows to sell crypto and receive fiat money to a bank account via the app,
  see
  [here](https://www.exodus.com/support/article/2435-sell-crypto-moonpay#mobile)
- Customer support

Cons:

- A swap may include a
  [spread](https://www.exodus.com/support/article/1591-what-is-an-exchange-spread)
- As any hot wallet is vulnerable to hackers attacks
  - It is not recommended to store significant amount of money

### Advanced

If you are experienced and / or own a lot of crypto you might want to have a
cold wallet on your laptop, holding the bulk of your bitcoin and transfer among
different website on-line wallets.

# Choose a crypto currency to receive money in

- One can either receive a payment in BTC or in one of the Stablecoins (USDT is
  a preference)
- People in the team prefer to use Stablecoins since Stablecoins pursue price
  stability

# Send a crypto wallet address

Send your crypto wallet address to GP together with an invoice via email. E.g.,
```
Hi GP,

Please find my invoice for the period [a, b] attached. I would like to receive the money in USDT ERC20.

My crypto wallet address is: 0x5ce3d650703f745B9C0cf20E322204b00bF59205
```

# Do a test transfer

For the first time GP sends a test transfer (e.g., 100$) just to confirm that a
wallet address provided works.

After a wallet address is "verified" send the full amount (exluding the test
transfer amount).

# Cash out crypto

## Bank account

There are some 3rd party services that buy crypto money from you and send fiat
money to your bank account

E.g.,

- [Built-in Exodus crypto withdrawal service](https://www.exodus.com/support/article/2435-sell-crypto-moonpay#mobile)
- [Coinbase cash out serivce](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-do-i-sell-or-cash-out-my-digital-currency)
- [Binance P2P](https://p2p.binance.com/en/trade/all-payments/USDT?fiat=USD)

## Cash
