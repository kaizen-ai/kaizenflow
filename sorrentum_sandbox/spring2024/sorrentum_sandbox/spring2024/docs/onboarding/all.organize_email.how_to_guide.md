# Mailing lists

- `@all` is the mailing list with everybody at the company
- `@contributors` is the mailing list with every open-source contributor

# Organizing email flow

- We receive tons of emails, and the inflow is going to keep increasing
  - At a large company you can get 10k emails per day (no kidding)
- The goal is to read all the emails and always be on top of it
- How can one do that?
  - As usual the answer is get organized
  - Filter emails in folders
  - Separate emails in folders based on the action that they require (e.g., ignore, just read and be aware of it, read and respond)
  - Read email and decide what to do about each of it:
    - No reply needed
    - Reply right away
    - Follow up later (e.g., to read, reply, think about it)
  - Use flags to distinguish what needs to be followed up later or if you are waiting for a response
- A possible organization in folders is:
  - GitHub
    - Commits in all the repos (be aware of it)
    - Issue updates (read and respond)
    - PRs
    - Commits directly to `master` (read and review)
    - Commits into `documents` dir of `master` (read and review)
    - Emails generated by my GH activities (ignore and mark as read)
  - Asana
    - Daily activities assigned report
    - New comment/activity
    - New task assignment

# Anatomy of email messages from infra

- The goal is to classify emails so that we can filter email effectively

## Filtering emails with Gmail

- Personally (GP) I prefer an email client (Mozilla Thunderbird and more recently Apple Mail) rather than using Gmail web interface
  - People are able to use it
- Personally I prefer to use filters on the Gmail (server) side
  - Pros
    - I don't get emails on my cell phone continuously
    - The emails are organized as they arrive
    - Folders are on the server side, so my client can simply sync
  - Cons
    - The Gmail interface for filtering emails is horrible
- The web interface is [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters)
- Note that Gmail distinguish different email accounts using different indices, e.g., [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<INDEX>/#inbox](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<INDEX>/#inbox)
