# From 0 to Web3 in 15 days

- Web3 / Defi / Crypto is a complex topic, but if you know what to read / study,
  it takes a short time to get up to speed and start building
- The focus of this guide is to get you learn by doing, instead of learning all
  the theory first
  - Once you see example and get you hands dirty, the theory will be much simpler
    to understand
- We've selected a set of resources to get you from 0 to Web3 developer in less
  than 2 weeks
  - Although you are surprise, this is possible
  - Several students with no knowledge of Web3 were able to get up to speed using
    the resources below
  - So it's just about putting the time and the result is guaranteed!

## Next steps
- To track your on-boarding to the stupendous world of Web3, file an issue on
  GitHub repo https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum assigned to you with the
  following checklist:
  - [ ] Make sure you can run the DeFi Docker container
  - [ ] Learn Solidity
  - [ ] Run the Web3 tutorials using Sorrentum toolchain
  - [ ] Get assigned a simple issue
  - [ ] Go through Prof Harvey's DeFi class

- Each action item is described below
- Once you have completed the action item, mark that done on GitHub

## Level 1: Being able to develop dApps in Solidity

### Run the DeFi container

- Follow the instructions https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum/blob/master/defi/README.md

### Learn Solidity
- You can learn Solidity with one of these books:
  - Tej's book: [Blockchain and Ethereum Smart Contract Solution Development:
    Dapp Programming with Solidity](https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Ethereum-Contract-Solution-Development-ebook/dp/B0BBQV4M9J)
  - [Hands-On Smart Contract Development with Solidity and Ethereum: From
    Fundamentals to Deployment](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Contract-Development-Solidity-Ethereum-ebook/dp/B081ZF73L8)

- We have copies of these books to borrow
  - If you need one, send an email to gsaggese@umd.edu

### Learn the Sorrentum Web3 toolchain
- Use our tutorials to build dApps in Python3, instead of nasty JavaScript
  - https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum/blob/master/defi/tutorial_brownie/tutorial_brownie.md

  - The tools we use are:
    - web3.py https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/
    - brownie: https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    - Solidity

## Level 2: Understand the DeFi high-level picture

- Prof. Harvey Coursera classes are a very good introduction covering 
  - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/decentralized-finance-duke

- Note that the course is **free** if you subscribe to one class at the time (and
  not the specialization) and you audit the class (see the button below)

  - [Class 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-infrastructure-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)
  - [Class 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-primitives-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)
  - [Class 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-deep-dive-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)
  - [Class 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-opportunities-and-risk-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)

## Level 3: Internals of blockchain

## Level 4: Tokenomics

There are several books I can recommend about Ethereum internals, and why Web 3
is as revolutionary as Internet itself (2020 - Token Economy - Voshmgir)
