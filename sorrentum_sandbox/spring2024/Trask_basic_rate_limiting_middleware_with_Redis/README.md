# Basic Rate Limiting Middleware with Redis

Description: Develop a sophisticated rate-limiting middleware leveraging Redis for efficient request tracking and enforcement within a Flask or Django web application. This middleware will intelligently throttle incoming requests based on predefined limits, ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing abuse. Utilizing Redis, the middleware will store request counters and expiration times, allowing for precise rate-limiting management. To enhance functionality, consider implementing features such as sliding window algorithms or token bucket strategies for more advanced rate limiting. Integrate the middleware seamlessly into your Flask or Django application to enforce rate limits with minimal overhead.
