# General

- [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com/) is a tool for remote working that automates:
  - time tracking
  - invoice creation
  - payment
- The goal is to replace our
  [hour log spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNd6ORhc94oUzg5nhNC7fQelN_PmfAv110F7lUiZsxo/edit#gid=0)
  with Hubstaff and get paid automatically for the worked hours.

# Time Tracking

## Privacy

- We have decided to turn off the feature of taking screenshots of the laptop as
  proof-as-work, URL, and app tracking.
  - <img src="figs/track_time_with_hubstaff/image3.jpg" />
- Although this seems to be standard practice for remote teams (e.g., it's
  default for UpWork), we don't believe in surveilling people, rather we prefer
  to assume that people do the right thing (until proven wrong, of course).

- We left enabled "the keyboard and mouse activity" since this is used to
  automatically track the worked time. The tool does not store what you type,
  only if you type as a proxy for "working".

    We let people decide if they want to monitor the usage of programs or not.
    Some people like it (I do since it gives an insight on which program I spend
    my time)

- You can change your mind over time.

## Tracking time automatically

- You can use the desktop [App](https://app.hubstaff.com/download)
  - I prefer this since it's completely automated
  - For Linux (Ubuntu) follow this
    [guide](https://support.hubstaff.com/install-and-sign-in-into-linux-desktop-client/)
- Both options update the time information to Hubstaff automatically.

## Tracking time manually

- You can track time using the
  [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hubstaff-time-tracker/mipeohjjimeknlkekbemdjbjniogbgel):
  - [Chrome Time Tracking - Hubstaff Time Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dXfD3EJb2M)
  - Start the timer when you start the work
  - Stop the timer when the work is paused

## Overriding time tracking

- In case you forgot to turn on the timer or you are tracking time manually, go
  to
  - <img src="figs/track_time_with_hubstaff/image5.png" />
    and fill the timesheet for the past day
