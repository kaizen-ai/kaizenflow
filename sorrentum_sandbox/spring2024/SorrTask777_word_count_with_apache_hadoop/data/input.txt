wants to sleep eight hours tonight. And so she shall.
really hates hormones and emotions right now. Well, has hated them a lot recently. Goodness.
has a watch that matches her glasses. She wishes she hadn't spazzed with glee when she saw it in the store.
loved 9! Allegory, symbolism, talking ragdolls, satire, and explosions! Yes!
can't sit on her futon because she knows as soon as she does she'll lie down and pass out. Uncomfortable rolly desk chair it is. :(

just made a nucketful of cookies and a bunch of baked fries. :) Yes, I am awesome.
has made more cookies, as well as a bunch of croissants for breakfast and piggies in various blankets for tomorrow afternoon. Despite the late//early hour, this is only further awesomeness.
has a fair idea of how to manage the 2.5 kids cliche... She just needs a very strong gentleman named *PROPNAME* and thriteen wet napkins.
saw Up. Also saw two Chuck Norris movies. FFFFFFFFFFFF- WEIRDEST MIX EVER.

feels tomorrow will be a busy and very nice day. :)

Yesterday after school, I got bored and decided to go into the backyard and play with my slingshot. I didn't have any ammo, so I just used peanuts and shot them at trees. I decided to shoot at one really far away. Out of nowhere, a squirrel leaped out of a tree, intercepted the peanut, landed on another tree, ate the peanut, gave me what looked like a thumbs-up, and ran away. Ninja squirrel, you amaze me. MLIA.

Face the facts. Then act on them. It's the only mantra I know, the only doctrine I have to offer you, and it's harder than you'd think, because I swear humans seem hardwired to do anything but. Face the facts. Don't pray, don't wish, don't buy into centuries-old dogma and dead rhetoric. Don't give in to your conditioning or your visions or your fucked-up sense of... whatever. FACE THE FACTS. THEN act.

I, I'm thinking it's a sign That the freckles in our eyes Are mirror images, and when we kiss They're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate That God himself did make Us into corresponding shapes Like puzzle pieces from the clay
is at work... yay.
thinks she will keep this as her profile pic until those tan lines fade, if that ever happens.
is stressed... but has great tickets for the game! row 1 baby! Woot!
got a jersy from *PROPNAME*, a clean car from her mother, and a free portfolio from her sister! Not too shabby for the unexciting 22nd birthday. :D Thank you everyone!
dealing with crazy people all day... A&A ppl: don't forget the lecture tonight! Not sure what it is about though... :P
>.<
absolutely hates AutoCAD.  Why am I still in architecture?
Come on UT: We need a touchdown!
is blah blah blah....but... TGIF!!! Happy weekend everyone!!!
GODDAMNIT!!!! FUCK YOU LINCOLN!!! Kick HIGHER! And the guy took off his helmit! We should have had a re-kick! What BS is this? AAAARRRRG!!!!!!
I just realized that the song "All I wanna do is make love to you" by Heart is about a woman picking up a stranger and seducing him in order to get a child... Wha?
GAAAARRRG!!!

a;lkdhoarjenfpreoijn

is inactive.
is upset.  *PROPNAME* ditched our appointment I made, after I waited in the office for about an hour, and now I'll probably never get to talk to her.  I wish she'd actually do her job in stead of taking 5 hour lunch breaks then leaving early.... Bitch.
is hungry.
needs to suck it up.
Due to a lack of anyone being interested in my life updates, I will write here and delude myself that someone wiill read it later and actually care...  Got a new phone yesterday: a Palm treo.  Had to pay $30 a mo extra to use it, but now I'll be able to use the interwebz while in White Bluff.  30 dollars is a fair price to put on cabin fever prevention. Maybe I should Tweet this too. :P
*PROPNAME* made it up to me today... after I waited for her for a half hour past our appointment time. Sheesh. But *PROPNAME* was awesome enough to let me have some hot chocolate :)

In our personal and professional lives, we are constantly hit with one adversity after the other, most of which we have no control over. But the four things we have total control over is how we react, how we adapt, how we breathe and how we take action.
The only people who are more entertaining then rappers are wannabe rappers. (See *PROPNAME*)

Exact words when renewing DL: Me: Oh no, you can't take my license, It's my 25th b-day. How am I going to get into the bar? DMV: We gonna give you a new one over there Me: But, it won't have my picture and stuff on it.  Dmv:  Hold up, we can take a picture of your picture and put it on a license i think. (yelling at co-worker to see if this can be done) Yup! Me: So, I can go to the bar?! Dmv: (sigh) Yeah girl!

Maybe that's why we vote for the presidents.

Some people say pain can be controlled by the mind. I do not agree with these people. It doesn't mean I don't admire them though.
Doctors seem to want me to sit out. In a wheelchair...no fucking way. I'd rather walk down the street with tears streaming, than be benched....which, unfortunately, is not too far off.
Well anyway, fuck it. I'm gonna die young but happy. Rather than healthy and old.
Gonna be 83 degree today ! Coffee, sunshine, and sweet email from a friend. Day started with love, is continuing, and will end in love.
Home...finally. Sooooo tired...gonna get a couple hours before work starts up again.
Alright, recharged as it were. If this is a night of no dark dreams; you are a miracle worker too.
Easy to read; I like that !
Sleeeeeeeeeep......
I find I'm enjoying tiny poetry.  Such as: Rain- My ears hear a drip, drop, splash It's more of a scream, laugh, live And you make it so hard not to be cliche. You pile on my dreams,  Like power lines on a sky. Is it raining where you are ?
Not tired, must sleep. Long week ahead, and no weekend. Friday is no longer a day off. Sore all over, but I asked for it. Cig, Loveline, sleep...smile, love, remember.
Today was a much needed day off !! Back to a fake smile tomorrow, but rejuvinated by friends tonight.
It's moments like this that I wish I worked for Walmart. I hate rape. I'm no good at counseling "victims". Especially when it's a parental perpetrator. Why is this the way of the world ? Why is it reality ?
Blah ! Work lots, need money. Not worth it really. I'm loosing the happiness !!
Sore throat starting out. Tempted to gargle vodka, but must get some work done.
Frustrated beyond all hell, blog isn't helping.
"I've been high, and I've been down, my head in the clouds and my hands on the ground. "
I think I would be dead without my heating pad. I am completely serious.
I don't know where my mind is in this moment. It's so fleeting; emotion. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. And like *PROPNAME* says, a shotgun just leaves a messed up wall.  Ah well. Random thoughts. Better go to bed before that crap goes deeper.
Gah, headache. Okay my body's failing me; I'm going to put off work 'til tomorrow and take care of myself now. Ice cream, giant sweater, warm bed...I'm comin'.
Okay, people, seriously..."lol" is so blood annoying when you use it on every line.
Fuck. Okay, file another tragic story in a box of my mind to be dealt with when I no longer have a heart. Wonder how much longer it'll take...not too long now.
Okay, I'm no good at positivity right now. That's my work "hat". So sue me.
Ah coffee....makes the world go 'round.
I feel emptied out; please rain down on me...darkness and light, come fill me up.
Okay, must sleep. Must work in mere hours...ah who am I kidding ? I don't sleep. Or eat. Just smoke...and work. And love.
Got the new iPhone 3GS. Don't ask how, I won't tell you. But thank you.
"I like my chicken fried, a cold beer on a friday night, a pair of jeans that fit just right, and the radio up !"
QTD: "'Flower' usually refers to a vulva in general, not virginity or 'cherry popping' as the kids would say." Hahahaha
"Little red bird under a chair, waiting for the crumbs to fall. Daddy said, 'Get a job'. Well don't you see, Daddy, how good I am at catching crumbs ?"
Aggrevated that I let someone else take me from really happy to hurt and depressed. It's on me to change my reaction to be one of Loveful Me.
I need to be asleep. I get up in....5 hrs ? No idea really. What am I doing again ?
"For a moment I love everything I see and think and feel..."
"Walking by the river I...reach my hands to cup the sky. It runs down my arms...a bitter blue. Turn to red, and the gashes grew." God, this song...every word is raw and honest.
I am what I make of myself. I am Love. I am.
I wish I was in NYC and seeing *PROPNAME* tomorrow night....
I need to go back to my live food diet. Not 90% like before, but I bet I could do 75% without losing too much weight..
It's ugly here. But there are sparks...moments. Love.
I guess it all depends on your mood...why can't these meds be any damn good ?
"I believe in love. It's just my heart that keeps turning me down. I believe in love, I think it's just fine."
I always want the blog to be the magical valve. Turn it on, write, be healed. It never is though. And now I still hurt, I just feel more raw now. As long as I stay with the emotion and don't deny...I'll be alright.
Fucking musicians. Fuck musicians...
<3
Now that I'm done writing, I need food...hmmm....
I did that shit with spasms, AND after 8 shots of espresso today. WHO DA MAN ?? Beauty school, here I come...right after this next Criminal Minds. <3
I have to find the superhero I use to be. I can't bring myself to believe it was just the Love of a silly boy that did it.
(Breast cancer awareness question - what colour bra are you wearing ?) No colour. I'm not a fan of bras lately. But this is a stupid FB idea. It doesn't really raise awareness unless you also say what the hell it's about !  Stupid, stupid.
My most awesome friend just surprise-attacked me with a present of a dark chocolate bacon bar...drool. Best. Moment. Ever.
Again, my company and night are ruined by some physical ailment of mine. I am fucking tired of it.
Wow, fresh air. Crazy. Good day sunshine, you're my favourite star.
Okay, sleep. Dreaming of bacon and dark chocolate. mmmm....
To be something I am not...that is what I'll be when I grow up. God, it'll be stunning.
Okay. Maybe not sleep.
Pain is a bitch.
Got called in to work tomorrow. At least I don't have to run groups. Bed early tonight.
Wow been a tiring and painful day. Gonna set up a movie and try to relax. Love to all of my beautiful friends and family for the support and awesomeness of who they are. And a high five to my Surgeon who is THE man and gives me hope of having a less painful life. <3 you all. You make me happy, yes YOU.
My most Awesome Surgeon says I can try walking today and if all goes well, I can work tomorrow !! YAY !! I'm gonna need the money if I wanna try and quit this job to focus on my other jobs//opportunities. Wish me luck on the walking ! I'll report back.
Just ate a nice happy cow filet with red wine reduction. Wish my feet weren't throbbing so I could really cook !! Tomorrow we shall throw down...my 12-in skillet and me.
Having surgery today. I can't wait to be in hospital. I'm not a big fan of surgery. But hospitals feel like home to me. Calming in the chaos.
Reading an amazing book called Stranger in a Strange Land. Now I'm listening to Loveline and trying to rest for the god-aweful full day tomorrow.
Off to a training, not back til Sunday. So tired. So in pain. Starbucks will make it all better, I know it !
Last day at work. I caught myself laughing at something horrific last night. Laughter is how I cope, but...I can't wait to laugh at happy things again.

Finished Steppenwolf. Not for everybody.

oh huh, this is 4th of July weekend coming up? Probably not the best time to try coming up...
"*PROPNAME* Teaches Trying?" *PROPNAME*, sometimes in your ceaseless effort to provide a slightly more depressing take on various topics, you come up with a bit of a stretch.
Hi Chicago, what's up
just saw Thirst. It was dark when I got out, and I was by myself, so I jogged part of the way home. Hell if I know why...scary wouldn't really be the word for that movie I don't think...
well that didn't work
Oh right, there is a diction exam tomorrow. Huh.
*PROPNAME* more convincing as the king than *PROPNAME*? Wow... I mean he's good and all, but I sure know one source of reviews to ignore now
Wow, *PROPNAME* was very small.
Hahahha Mad Men. "You can't sing." "Take that back...I quit the Tigertones because I had mono." "I am so high right now." hahaahaha
after months of failure, I am going to try to come up to LA for a day before everybody disappears. I'm thinking this Friday?

Refrigerator: "Drrrrrr" Lights: "Flicker..."
Okay, songs for bass//low baritone and orchestra: Songs and Dances of Death The Vagabond Le Bal Masque Old American Songs Ich Habe Genug The Ravel and Ibert Don Quixote cycles then all those Mozart concert arias what else?
My first thought was "wow, everybody is having birthdays at once...what a coincidence!" Then I remembered all of those profiles we made for Threepenny...
wishes people could just agree on one perfect technique and have done with it!
slept so much last night
WOAH, tough day! GO GO GO REGROUP DOMINATE AHHHHH

In The Loop on Opera: It's just vowels, subsidized foreign f***ing vowels. Hahahahaha
Hmm...it might finally be time to get a coat.
feels pretty ooky, but is going to try to power through and sing in everything tomorrow anyway. Good idea? Let's watch!
Every time I log in to something and I see one of those checkboxes next to the words "Remember Me," I can't help but think - ever so briefly - "but ahhhhh, for-r-ge-et my faaate."
No more student tickets for opening night at the lyric opera! Hmm... How unmissable is tomorrow going to be? I'm thinking I may go anyway.

[h?-lo? ?-v??-ba-di hau a? ju]
It's pretty amazing how many hours are required to organize a presentation that is going to last no more than twenty minutes. This would be so much simpler if I could just call Haydn as a witness.
I finally went grocery shopping. Picked up a small piece of raclette, not knowing what it was, because I wanted something to put on crackers. Turns out it is supposed to be melted over a flame or special grill and then immediately scraped onto some kind of bread. Whyyyy did I get such a difficult cheese? Will just putting it right on a pan or toasting it somehow work? I guess we'll see!
Streeterville? Wrigleyville? Printer's Row? What is this
just ate a ton of sugar woaaahhh... Explain to me again why I'm not ripped?

realized today he had no idea what was in eggnog, and looked it up, secretly expecting to find that it was made from something horrible. It is actually made of far more wonderful ingredients than I ever could have imagined!
was a huge baby when he had his wisdom teeth out a few years ago. Just splayed out on the couch whining constantly. His sister, however, had them out today and treated it like it was nothing!

Wow, *PROPNAME*...I've never heard anything quite like that in person! My search for similar sounds has led me to *PROPNAME*, so very productive post-concert internet session. SO COOL
I just dreamed the mob kidnapped me and was forcing me to host a toothpaste infomercial. The draw for the toothpaste is that it was used by athletes in the Olympics. I kept getting all the names and locations wrong because nobody told me what they were. A burly guy in a suit was getting pretty upset cause we were stopping so much. He was on the roof for some reason. The set looked suspiciously like my backyard. Huh.

Overpopulation will only accelerate until we need walled cities to keep out the hungry, swarming, insane masses. And they will scrape and dig under the walls like bug eyed mole men. You say catastrophe. I say, fuck yes.

"Why is America like Michael Jackson?  Both achieved their peaks with a moonwalk performed decades ago" ~ *PROPNAME*

Hot: *PROPNAME* is an awesome TA.

I have 6 cliques in my Facebook network.
Just sewed on my first button.

is feeling a little subbydub today.
has a new baby sister!  Little Baby No-Name!
just found an organization called Think Before You Speak that flips out about people saying, "that's gay," claiming that it's offensive.  That's pretty gay, if you ask me.

just scrubbed the inside of the car.  In the dark.  With the mosquitoes.
just got back from the pool.  Wow, I'm exhausted...
stayed up to finish The Kite Runner last night, probably around four in the morning.  I'm not sure because I don't have a clock up there! lol
just finished "There Are No Children Here."  It was horrendous.
s little sister told her that she could "ride her tricycle with no handlebars."  As long as you don't start singing their more political songs, sweetie.  :P
just planned the perfect field trip. ^^
spent 1 hour in the car, 2 hours in Potomac Mills, only went to 2 stores, and got just a cup out of the whole day.  WOW.
is going to try drawing upstairs.  Didn't work so well in the car.  Usually a change of atmosphere helps.
The early bird gets the worm...but the second mouse gets the cheese in the trap.  Words to live by.  I do, at least.
just got back from the zoo.  No gray wolves, no girraffes...really not much of anything.  :(
s mom can't find a cheap orange Jansport backpack online because *PROPNAME* used one in Twilight, so everyone's paying top-dollar for them.  Hilarious.  :D
is having fun learning the 12 Principles of Animation.  Also, I drove on a road for the first time yesterday.  Don't worry; it was just a few blocks, and everyone should be back on their feet in no time.  ;)
just told *PROPNAME* died.  There was a short pause.  "We need a new *PROPNAME*."  Nice.
s hamster died last night. :(
Tuition at Rhode Island is 35 grand!!
The girl walking me to my classes today asked me if I played any sports.  HAHAHAHA HA ha ha ha...Ahh, that's funny.  Silly cheerleaders.
might need to make an easier "how-well-do-you-know" quiz.  Go take it and tell me.  ; )
just found out that you lose your sense of smell when you sleep.  Interesting.

s mom just said, "*PROPNAME*'s right!"  LOL!
*PROPNAME*'s tantrum has finally come to a close.  Phew!  (Read my note for more details ;) )

really thinks there's NO WAY she'll finish that collage by tomorrow.  Seriously.

s Venus' fly trap caught its first bug: a little gnat.  Aww, they grow up so fast...
LOVED the new Family Guy the other night.  Watching the Disney scene was a lot of fun.  On that note, it's all animated in Korea.  What is up with that?  Can't we animate our own shows in our own country?!
has a new cell number: (229) 251-4618.  Save it now.  SAVE IT!
had a half day today!  Yay!
New Bones yesterday, new Soup and Dog Whisperer tonight, and new Simpsons and Family Guy Sunday!  And I've brought my science grade up from an 84 to a 91!  WOOOO!
Really needs to plan out the next two days carefully... Hmm...  ¬_¬
s mom is playing Scrabble.  Mom: "What the heck does 'rehem' mean?  Oh, wait; that was my word."  I think she needs to go lay down like *PROPNAME* for a little while.
is alive.  You should try it sometime; it's a lot of fun.
jumping on the lyrics-for-status bandwagon: Don't let apathy police the populace, we will march across those stereotypes that were marked for us. The answer's obvious; we switch the consonants and change the "sword" to "words" and lift continents.  9//11 <3
watched the President's speech yesterday.  Wow, I'm SOOO indoctrinated!  [//sarcasm]  Stupid radical jerks...
tiny fingers...can't type...pinky hurts...too many octaves...Why? Why, genetics, why?
thinks people should either do something or shut up and deal!  We were the (pretty much) first country to have a peaceful transfer of power between political parties.  Let's go back to those times, shall we?  If you're not gonna do anything about what you don't like, then please, shut up and leave everyone else alone. kthxbi.
s weird cat came inside not for a bowl of food, but for a bowl of water.  I poured some water over near where he was outside and he came trotting over straight into my arms!  XD
WHAT?  WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT ZOMBIELAND WAS FILMED AT WILD ADVENTURES?!  So those guys trying to recruit LHS students for a "big movie making fun of zombie movies filmed near WA and in the woods" were actually legit!  OMG I have to go see it! Also, all you people in Valdosta fail for not telling me about it! ;)
can't believe how many restaurants and stores didn't have their flags at half-staff today!  How can you possibly forget what today is, especially if the building right next to you has theirs at half-staff?  9//11 <3
New cell number: (555) 555-5555
helps the police, because nice police are nice to me! XD
Serving God is doing good to man, but praying is thought an easier service and is therefore more generally chosen.
just posted her Amazon Christmas list on here.  Be sure to read the notes at the top!!
"The role of Bruce Wayne//Batman was originally offered to *PROPNAME*, but he turned it down." WHAT??!
would like to remind everybody that we live in a multicultural society composed of more than just Christians, that this country was NOT built off of Christianity (in fact, many of our Founding Fathers were Deists, not Christians) and the only ones keeping Christ out of Christmas are the people who insist on filing lawsuits for not saying "Christmas" instead of spending their time caring for others!  Happy Holidays!
just got back from camping.  I feel so disgusting...
thinks that maybe if more real guys were more like *PROPNAME* from Dragon Age, she might be more willing to date.  Yes, I seriously just said that.
*PROPNAME*. ;)
thinks *PROPNAME* deserves yet another apology from Warner Brothers.  For multiple reasons.  How do you leave out the big, climactic battle scene of a book?  How does that happen?  And then you turn around and add in an entire scene that not only didn't happen, but also makes no sense whatsoever.
is watching the Dog Whisperer where an aggressive Chihuahua rules all the pit bulls at a pit bull rescue!
freakin. Loves. Photoshop.  Now if only I could find some classes...
doesn't know what to do for some people for Christmas!  D:
is frustrated...
got her game fixed!  Almost done, now...just a few more rooms, then off to the evil dragon!  I have a feeling something bad's gonna happen.  Just a hunch...
just watched a documentary on 9//11 conspiracy theorists.  Those have got to be the most low-down, small-minded, egotistical, self-centered, uncaring, ignorant, heartless monsters I have ever seen.
Ugh, nevermind.  Got stuck and had to backtrack.  Might as well do all the side quests while I'm at it.  Maybe I'll finish by freaking Friday...
feels pretty confident about the Chemistry test tomorrow.
Wow, DA is tossing out achievements like crazy.  Good ones, too.  Also, I cannot type today to save my life.  I can't tell you how many times I had to hit the backspace while typing this. X-l
"The world may end in 2012 but this show won't." XD LOL!
Hmm, that wasn't too bad. Had me worried for a minute.  I've certainly seen worse endings. Like freakin' Fallen! Seriously, what the crap was that?! Anyways, not bad. ^^
Huh. I stand corrected.
Why? Why does BioWare have to be so mean to me? I KNOW Mass Effect 2 is out! Leave me alone! DX

No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day. Nor should people be forced to go without insurance because the cost of... "insuring" oneself is more than their cost of living.

Know what sucks, when there is this one person who the first time you saw them you thought they had absolutely one of the most lovable personalities and nicest smiles ever and you try to let them know that they mean so much to you in the little time you have around them and somewhat fail to do that then you keep in touch with them nearly every week you're not around them for a year and you see them only
both times you plan to tell them that and fail each time, so you right one of the longest, heartfelt notes about them to show them the next time you're with them and when you finally find your grand chance to see them and maybe finally tell them that they've meant more to you than anyone else you've ever known you find out that they've just got into a relationship with someone else.
saw airforce one yesterday on Otis Airforce Base.
just got back from a Nickelback concert.
enjoyed doing Thriller on stage at the Oktoberfest

Classety Class class class... :\
No one should be frozen in carbonite, or be slowly digested for a thousand years in the bowels of a sarlaac, just because they couldn't pay *PROPNAME* what they owe him. If you agree, post this as your status.

Congratulations All-hallowians, I enjoyed a wonderful concert!

Question... does anyone actually use the poke feature on facebook anymore?
Thinks that chrome has come a long way since the first time he tried it, and has gotten fed up enough with Firefox that he's willing to give it another shot.
Has 8 invites to google wave... I'd love to try it out with anyone that has a shared class with me. Let me know if you want in!
Would like to thank everyone for the wonderful birthday wishes... It's quite pleasant to be harrassed by facebook 1 day a year ;)

Wowza running tomorrow morning supa early
MUST WORK, but the facebook demands my time!

thinks that it is impossible to be TOO heavenly minded. Watch. Those who are "too heavenly minded" will do the greatest good here.
A prospering tree does not eat it's own fruit. A prospering tree produces fruit that others might eat.
"knowledge without repentance will be but a torch to light your way to hell"
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Holy! Holy! Are you Lord God almighty! Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb that was slain! Unto you be all glory and honor and praise! May my life bring glory to your name :)
is praying hard to be just one who scatters seed on the earth.
wonders at the absolute absurdity of man's hatred...Christ summed up all the goodness we are capable of in two commands...none of us even follows just one of them.
says happy fathers day! In honor of my heavenly Father, who's never forsaken me or let me down. May you ever be praised, Dad :)
Is going completely insane with anticipation :) T-minus 24 hours til *PROPNAME*'s arrival in Nashville!
God is faithful to His word and to those to whom He has given it
An awakening? Lord awaken the sleeper. Let our eyes burst open to the rising light of Your Spirit. Let Your mercy wash us and let Your holiness mold us into the image of Your Son. Break us with fire and build us from the ashes. Come to life you dry, old b

Whatever good I do comes not from me. Goodness is of God, and through me He chooses to make His power known. Thank You, Lord.
is being conformed to the image of Christ. Do you want to be like Jesus? Then you must learn something...you must learn how to love someone who does not meet the conditions. It's not easy, but it's not impossible.
Lord let your glory fall as on that ancient day. Let it fall on both of them. Let your grace be made known eternally and mightily.
When paul says "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"...I think, "I can do nothing without You, dear Jesus, who strengthens me"
hungers and thirsts for righteousness.
Truly knows so little. Thank You, Oh Lord, that You are wise and You are mighty. Thank You, Lord, that Your grace knows no limits or bounds. I pray You're will be done here on earth as it is in heaven and that we give You glory with our lives.
is. Learning to be at peace and just be is harder than it should be ;). Lord you are. You just ARE. Teach me to be like you. Teach me to be.
will gladly boast in his weaknesses. When I am weak, then He is strong. Your might, oh Lord is endless. Please cover over me. Please cover over your beloved..Lest we  all fall in overwhelming shame under the weight of our imperfections.
let me be one who leans on his staff in the last days...broken and weak, and in that weakness let me lift my hands in honor and praise to He who saved me by His own merit. Thank You dear Father who makes His goodness known in me. May You be glorified.
is a tax collector who standing afar off would not even raise his eyes to heaven. I pray, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
stop regarding men. What account is he? --isaiah 2:22.. We are nothing more than a nose-full of breath. Oh man, how frail are you? Why do you expect regard? Why do I?
is a deer panting for your living water. I thirst for the living God and in my thirst I need your rest. Precious Lord, carry me for even at my strongest I lack the strength to stand on my own. Amen
Gimme your eyes for just one second. Gimme your eyes so I can see. Everything that I keep missin, gimme your love for humanity. Gimme your arms for the broken-hearted, the ones that are far beyond my reach...
Jesus. You're the lover of my soul. Jesus. I will never let you go. You've taken me from the mirey place; set my feet upon the rock, and now I know...
is excited her :D For serious, that's all i can think about
Because you, oh Lord, are He who created all things, sustains all things, and knows all things. All things came from you, are of you, and will return unto your breast from whence they came. Blessing and honor and glory to you, oh Father. This is the song of my spirit...praising its origin. You. My God.
is excited to see her :D For serious, that's all i can think about
Lord, be my portion. Christ trusted you to provide all the help He ever needed. Let me do the same.
loves being broken. It means I fought hard and didn't give up. I'll wrestle with you, oh God of Jacob, and I won't let go.
thinks its a kind of non-funny cosmic joke that if he really ever does defeat pride...he will find himself proud of his humility. :P Good call *PROPNAME*
Let me know you more deeply and truely, oh Lord. There are none who know you completely, and so I pray that YOU show me. Your ways are perfect and I want my life to sing your praise. Let me walk with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
Dude, I'm freaking engaged! To the sweetest angel of a fiance ever! Thank you Lord for your love through this woman :D
I love *PROPNAME* 0:)
is anxiously attached. I don't know how to ask for help. And I don't know how to accept it. ---i'll drag my own intestines back to dyer, thank you very much.
"hope in a wasteland of faith; stone figures hewn down; blood flowing through ancient sewers"
I can't remember when the earth turned slowly...so i'll just wait here with the lights turned out again. I lost my place, but I can't stop this story. I'll find my way, but til then I'm only...spinning
Lord please bless our time together. Its so difficult to go so long without being with the treasure You have graced my life with. I pray that you bring her to me safely and that I pursue her well.
This will probably take a good long while to get used to :) I think I'm still in shock. Haha. I have a fiance. Wow. And not just any fiance; I am pursuing the pearl of great value :D
Everlasting, Eternal One, Zealous Conqueror, Creator, Sustainer, Almighty...how can I appeal to your highest pleasure. What can I bring to you that you do not already have? Vanity. Even to define my mission as one to bring you glory is utter foolishness. What can I lift up with these dirty hands? What can I sing with defiled lips?
is waiting on the Lord this morning
To understand how ridiculously excited I am to see my fiance, you must first win the lottery, do somersaults, run a hundred miles effortlessly, wake up to birds chirping, eat a super-yummy meal, and be addicted to oxygen...then you might get close to scratching the surface. Maybe
is examining himself. 2 Cor 13:5. Testing himself to see if he is in the faith. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose. Phillipians 2:12-13
we're goin down down in an earlier round...a loaded god complex is pointed right at us. Lord, please be God here. Please bless our hearts of love
bring on this semester :) What fun things will I learn?? Only God knows :) ..someone's always missing from this campus though.. last term without her...sigh*
is with his darling...oh what simple things many take for granted. Thank you Lord for your gift of life. Thank you Lord for *PROPNAME* :)
"I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won. No one can take away the blood that covers over my bones. Without the blood of perfect life I know I'm nothing at all."
is not with his darling anymore :( sad day(s)...Lord, be my sustanence as you always are. Especially now that much of my joy is 700 miles away from me. I love you *PROPNAME*, and I miss you!
"We are the sons of holy wrath,A shining light in the darkThe ones who walk amongst despair,No sign of fear in our hearts"
6am on a saturday is far to early to drag one's self out of bed...ugh, God thank you for this morning..even though I'd like to be sleeping it away...It really is a beautiful morning :)
What makes people happy? Apparently we really suck at knowing what makes us happy. Its a measurable, replicable scientific fact. I dunno why that strikes me funny. lol. Lord, teach us to be joyful in you.
I don't know how it all works. I don't know why. I don't know how. I just am who you made me. I have what you gave me. Let me be yours. Please take all I have as yours. Let me be holy and of you. I desire for my life to boil your vapor from my skin forever. Burn everlasting flame. Flinted face, calloused knuckles, and grinding teeth...my best. That's what you got.
"I believe the world is burning to the ground. Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out"--How far have we come, Lord? Let us make the most of the time we do have here. We waste TOO much time on so many things that don't matter. Its not worth it. Really.
life never seems to stop changing. Its crazy to think college is almost over. Wow. Lord, please guide the steps of my life as it is so formless yet traced before me.
Dude, its freaking snowing!!!!! Yay!!!! Let's play in it!
"I gotta feelin. Woohoo...that tonight's gonna be a good night" :) I like it when prayer's answered sweetly and things work out well. Thanks God :)
So much to say. So much to do. So much to be. So little time. 24 hours is already to small an amount of time. Its hard to be without you.
Does it really take cancer or death to bring us to have a heart for our family? Really? Lord, at this rate, it'll take You coming on the clouds, blowing our minds and shaking us from our complacent lives...complacent in the daily grind. Complacent in our justifiable self-pity. Complacent in our self-centeredness. It'll take You to show us how wrong we all are.
has walked a thousand miles with grace so far. I could walk like this forever...Jesus how can you be so good to me?? May you be praised in every step I take. Always
"I believe it all is coming to an end. Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend". Ever feel like a five-year-old who is content to cover his//her eyes to feel safe and secure? If I can't see you, you can't see me..lol..I want us all to stop ignoring the important things. They won't go away if you ignore them. I promise.
neoplatonic thinking postulates "the one" is infinite and gives rise, eventually, to this world of 'becoming". Lord you were, are, and forever will be. My one. May I draw all life and thought from Your essential creativity. May I be made to be like Your form. Good.
I like where we are. here :)...except...where's my julie?????? :(((. I don't like where we are anymore...
"No demanding without understanding" --*PROPNAME*
"Ever since the day I was born i've been deciding the end..." let your light guide my way, oh Lord. You are the great shepherd.
As long as I'm alive, I'd die for you. Thank You Lord for your love and Your awakening it within me.
"All these weirdos, and me getting a little better every day...I had never known...that there might be a place for people like us"--*PROPNAME*
"Wilt thou change this world... Or wilt thou change thyself?"...can't i do both?
*PROPNAME*. The spice of life. Apparently its one of my signature strengths :). How can I help make your life more adventurous today? Thank you, Lord, for making me salt and light.
Screw you AXLE
"why art thou cast down oh my soul?" Oh yeah, because my darling isn't here. Lord, this is a high calling indeed.
Thank you, Lord, for today :) The day that three  years ago you let me start to make mine the most amazing woman ever! :) I love you *PROPNAME* :)
Happy Valentine's day everybody! And especially   to my sweet fiancee (with two "e's"), *PROPNAME* , who makes this day very very  special  for me! Hey ya'll don't take for granted that you can hold the  one you  love in your arms. I'd give both of my arms just to see my love  right  now.
Though the air is cold outside, I pray You warm our hearts with Your love.
Just updated my profile...Much has changed since college!
Scouty is going to the Doctor...
Holiday is over....crap....

Happy Brithday *PROPNAME*!!  Have a stadium dog for me!
Back in the ATL, but still just as foggy...luckly work is falling into place without me even doing anything...
Getting ready for my suprize trip to MI...I wish it was under better circumstances

I would give my left ear to be able to watch the big ten network I ordered, thanks for ruinung my game day comcast...
At home, trying to remember who I am related to and witch kids belong to witch cousin....and craving polish food.  In another devolopment, I thought I would be able to escape country music in the north, but in reality it is worse...
Even though my own sister is a blood traider....GO GREEN!!  GO ND!!!
I have a slash in my convertable top.  2 days before I leave for my beach vacation.  Someone is a serious asshole.
Breaking News: At the Atlanta Zoo, an old guy with a long white beard was caught try to lure 2 of each animal out of the exhibits.  It is also reported that he arrived in a large wooden boat...
I am glad to say that my parents arrived in Michigan safely...even if thier bags are lost...
What do *PROPNAME* and the Miami Dolphins have in common? They make 70,000 people stand up and yell "Jesus Christ"...
What is this world coming to when a complete ahole douchebag like *PROPNAME* is making an apolgy tour, but still as not called the girl to personally say I am sorry?  This is the role models for kids?  In a realted note, we will be out of the recession when the Americans who want to work can, not one moment before...I am feeling feisty today...
One of my prospective students just asked me out...is it 3 yet?  This week has been crazy...
*PROPNAME* is terrified of the half deflated mylar balloon outside of our condo, when we went for a walk she barked at it and then peed all over herself when I grabbed it to toss it out.  She is such a frady pup!
The guy next to me getting a mani//pedi tonight reminded me of someone my dad would golf with...kinda reminded me of home until he started singing along with the radio to Ace of Base, Madonna, and Cher.  It was so hard not to laugh!! So Atlanta!
I did not realize that *PROPNAME* (the guy from "to catch a predator") went to MSU, that is actually pretty cool.  He is a bad ass in a turtleneck!
Almost the weekend...only a few more short hours...I think we can make it.
What in God's name happened to cnn.com?
I fell on the way to my car this morning...I hope that is not the predictor of a bad day!
dang...is this what people feel like when the wings take it all??  Personally when the wings take it all in the cup it makes me smile, but for some reason a suprizing number of people are not red wings fans...
*PROPNAME* cant wait to dress up and go trick or treating!
I think quite possibly that MSU is one of the only teams in the Big Ten where the other team can have that many penalties and we still lose...the pizza pizza bowl is a GOAL now...and hockey is sucking a big one...when does basketball start?
Hey Atlanta: you may see my work on the evening news...Some guy was shot in the foot in our parking lot, that we share with the probation office...I have heard rumors he shot himself...
If you push print once....you only get one copy, so dont look at me like a moron when I bring you the 6 other copys from the 6 other times you pressed print...
I think that *PROPNAME* was embarassed that we were blasting the Glee soundtrack while crusing around with the top down...I can't imagine why
My mom and I were talking about all the food that reminds me of home last night, now I am a little home sick.  I love this time of year in Michigan!
I think I am going to start a Book Club with my girlfriends...any of you peaches intersted.  In my mind it will be a good excuse to sit around and drink wine and maybe talk about the book for a few minutes...
I just keep reminding myself...one week until my vacation, one week until my vacation....
NO NO NO *PROPNAME* cannot have a crush on Shoe...
How did a hobbit get on Flash Forward? That show is so crazy...
I cannot believe that I am celibrating going to the Pizza Pizza Bowl...
As much as I love Twlight (Team Taylor!), it is just me, or is it extreeme to be taking kids to see it tonight that are still in elementary school when they have school tomorrow! I guess taking kids period, with the attacks and sexual stuff....
My mouth always gets me in trouble...
Hopefully this week will not kick my butt...I don't think I can take it again
Wow...I should have watched more baseball this year...the twins are playing really well...crap...
So Glee was not so bad...here is the question, is the diva going to tell the ladies and that is how *PROPNAME* is going to find out that *PROPNAME* is the father
Rest in Peace Uga the Bulldog, the world of college mascots morns you today
Maybe it was a seisure?  She seems ok today, no weird movements, eating and drinking, and her cagemate is acting normal...I read online that strokes are common but it doesnt sound like they bounce back that quick...
Since when did you become the center of the universe?
I am dreading glee this week...
Under the cover of shameful darkness, my now former sister became a fan of Michigan football.  Because you did not go there, or any of our family for that matter...that makes you, my former sibling, a WALMART WOLVERINE...yes I went there!  We will see where your loyalties lie when you need a kidney or a piece of my liver...GO NITTANY LIONS!!
This rain has gotten me down today, that and the fact that my flat iron died...bad hair and I am cranky...At least I can look forward to Glee tonight!
Well, I didnt see that coming...
Putting together my coverletter and resume...I think I can I think I can I think I can
What doesnt kill me will make me stronger...
Day looking up, I will be able to exchange the defective flat iron!  I realized that New Moon comes out when I will be home for Thanksgiving, any body want to go see it with me?  Still looking forward to Glee...I feel a little dirty thinking that *PROPNAME* is hot
When doing your Christmas cards, take one or more and send it to this address: A Recovering American Soldier c//o *PROPNAME* Army Medical Center 6900 Georgia Avenue NW; Washington, D.C. 20307.

So, my tickets for Saturday's Spartan wallop of the *PROPNAME* are in the mail, I should have them tomorrow...Does anyone want to go see U2?
Let go Spartans LETS GO!
Time Mag named this decade the worst since WWII.  My only thought is, has there really been enough decades since WWII to be able to clearly desern that this one is the worst?  Granted these last ten years have really kinda sucked as far national tragity...but is there a need to call it the worst since WWII?
Today did suck...*PROPNAME* came home with 40 mega rolls of one ply toilet paper....I am going to be using prison tp until at least Easter!
Wow I am really in a funk...I had no idea *PROPNAME* was fired! I knew it was most likely going to be his last season, but I hardly ever miss stuff like that
Why are people from NeW Jersey so proud of being from New Jersey?
I was just watching "*PROPNAME* in Real Life" while I was working on my Christmas cards, and I just realized...*PROPNAME* (*PROPNAME*)  is the cop that pulls *PROPNAME* over and has his cruiser backed into.  HE IS WAY BETTER LOOKING WITHOUT THAT HAIR!
So, I got something in my eye and rubbed it and now it looks like I got punched in the face...everyone was making domestic violence jokes at the party...
Does this have to happen tonight...I have my fight club
I am in a funk today...I dont know if it is depression, maybe a lack of motivation because of depression.  This process is not for the impatient.
Thank God for facebook or everyone would have names misspelled on thier cards...
My thanksgiving utopia lasted a whole hour...new record.

What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. Steve Jobs

He's doing well now, I think his leg is better, it's all about preventing complications//infections now. Pictures later. Time to go to *PROPNAME*'s Bdat picnic.
in heeding the words of wise ninja master over a beer, *PROPNAME* has created a program of self-defense for the complete n00b who has 17 left feet.  Tonight, I shall see if anyone shows up to learn it.
The lizard known as The Tropical Thunder, passed on monday night.    He perked up after the leg fix, but he was already too far gone from neglect at the pet store.

(Rap performed by *PROPNAME*) Darkness falls across the land The midnite hour is close at hand Creatures crawl in search of blood To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood And whosoever shall be found Without the soul for getting down Must stand and face the hounds of hell (continued below)
is tired of being sick. Death to all swine.
(continued from above) And rot inside a corpse's shell The foulest stench is in the air The funk of forty thousand years And grizzly ghouls from every tomb Are closing in to seal your doom And though you fight to stay alive Your body starts to shiver For no mere mortal can resist The evil of the thriller (Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo)

Thinks whoever decided to schedule a massive apartment building fire next door to our new home at this time of day(5isham) was terribly inconsiderate, no fires until at least breakfast.  Off to hose the outside of the house after being up until 2am mortaring the downstairs.
has the flu.  i was so uninclined to move that I actually watched a football game. I made due by pondering the mechanics of impact, timing and footwork in play by play cases. Also created an under 5 yard endzone score for which there is no defense, I call it the the crane technique.
OSIT!
now has lens flare, Thanks *PROPNAME*.
needs to get a nifty book, a language version and a development environment that actually work together. I've got this Book on Python for Hacking//reverse engineering, but it's for 2.5, which is a not compatible old standard(current is 3+) and for an older version of Eclipse, which has also had a massive change in the current version and this book was published in 2009.
would like to thank everyone for the Birthday wishes.  It was a very tame, but very nice birthday.   also, I'd like to recommend Ninja Assassin, everything that is good about ninja with excellent choreography.

Raid Data Recovered completely from swapped pair that was unrecognized by nas after NAS flipped out and wiped itself 100 times.  400Gb data now safe.
approves of his raise.
Thinks this is awesome. http:////www.alternative-energy-news.info//ultra-lightweight-bendable-batteries//
anyone ever rebuild a raid array before and have tips? I've got two drives of a raid 1+0 (one from each pair i think), that need to have data recovered. Trying different recovery software at the moment (ufs recovery atm), but happy to have any advice.
has emptied his closets and clothes box from the move and is completely reorganizing everything, it looks like a clothes bomb went off in his bedroom.
Cthulhumas, Cthulhumas, Cthulhu eats your brains. Oh what fun it is to die in many horrible ways.  Cthulhumas, Cthulhumas, Cthulhu eats your brains. hey.  May you all be touched by his noodly appendage during these holy days.

Thank Cthulhu it's friday!
Happy New Years!
watched and heard 4" thick branchs near the top of one the Pine trees in my backyard snapping under snow weight and taking branches with it.    I saw that, said oh crap, let's go have a look, ran out, look up, realized I was under the remainder and said oh crap, let's go back in.  It's Ragnarok!  Prepare for the end!
is not surprised the states most utilizing their natural energy endowments are facing the smallest budget gaps for the upcoming fiscal year. California: your move
wonders, what's the use of having a bulwark against cloture if you can't exercise party discipline anyway.
is reading his packet for law school orientation. This is all very exciting and petrifying at the same time.
sends his blessings to those who keep the embers of freedom alight. Happy Independence Day!

is highly amused. The comparisons between *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*, as well as claims of her narcissism, are a classic case of psychological projection. (*PROPNAME*, really? Just how frightened are they of this woman?) The MSM are actually referring to no
rarely ever gets sick. Hopefully this will pass quickly.
was happy to learn it wasn't a furlough but a scheduling mistake that created the lapse. Back to work tomorrow.
is attending the Royal Fireworks Festival & Concert tonight at Riverfront Park.
is feelin' much better (and stronger everyday)
is now on (the) twitter. This had better be worth it.
is reminded of the underpants gnomes when listening to the HHS Secretary ignore clear evidence that socialized medicine won't lower health care costs.
came home to a box of Panda licorice, a favorite. I feel loved.
"I may be limping, but I'm coming home"
is wishing his Kitty a happy (and momentous) two-month anniversary.
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." - *PROPNAME*
wonders, with all this righteous indignation over a terrorist assassination program and change in tactics from pursuing the Taliban to protecting the population, when did this stop being a war?
is on the road again and deeply saddened to be separated from the Kitty for the rest of the week.
has on his soothsayer cap: [One day, parents who send their children to "super-gold-plated-Cadillac" private schools will pay additional taxes to cover the educational expenses of lower income families]
is doing a little catch-up work but excited to start school tomorrow.
R.I.P. *PROPNAME*
is steadily developing an iron butt. And no, he hasn't been to the gym lately.
will concede health care is a moral issue when the same proponents acknowledge abortion is immoral.
is pleased the American people will now have the time to read the government-run health care bill or have it interpreted for them. Apparently, this is a luxury our representatives (and President) couldn't find the time in their busy schedules to accomplis
is one lucky guy. First class, first day as a 1L and I'm the first to be called on to state the case. Thankfully, I did alright.
is thinking, what's not to love about a city that hosts a festival called, "Pig Out in the Park"
is looking forward to a steak dinner tonight in celebration of four years together as a couple.
always says, whatever doesn't kill you makes you luckier.
is thankful; only Justice Scalia's wit could make CIv Pro bearable reading at this hour.
is pondering the contradictions in his fidelity to a jealous mistress.
reminds those engaging in civil discourse; when you have to resort to accusations of racism, you're probably losing the debate.
wonders which is more inappropriate; heckling during a Presidential address to Congress or the President himself calling a private citizen a "jackass".
It's beginning to look a lot like Washington around here.
has settled on a parish. Happy days.
is in Santa Clara to see the family. Still missing the Kitty.
was greatly disappointeed with the disgustingly partisan scriptwriting on Law and Order last night.
Mr Hart's 1L advice: when preparing for the socratic method, remember to think in questions.
remembers the good old days when we could pay for everything under the sun by "bringing the troops home". It amazes me how inconsistent we can be when the Birkenstock is on the other foot.
*PROPNAME* was bad enough, but at least he distorted data and concocted fear-mongering chartsngrafs to support his cockamamie theory. The Norwegian Nobel Committee just lost its credibility--forever.
wonders if serfs living under a nationalized health care scheme lead healthier lifestyles mostly for fear of becoming sick//injured and having to throw themselves at the mercy of its poor services.
doesn't think passing a bill on *PROPNAME*'s casket would legitimize killing health care for the rest of us.
is thinking of a movie title; Dr. Strangehair or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cue Ball Look
is making a four-minute oral argument tomorrow. Should be interesting.
thinks people in straw houses shouldn't blow hot air...or propose a homeowner's insurance public option for that matter.
reckons it's looking a lot like Washington in California right now.
wasn't disuaded post-media blitz. Still thinks taxes are an appropriation of wealth, mandates are backed implicitly with a gun and "freedom from want" is a condition better reserved for animals and small children.
thinks he did alright. Not necessarily kicking asterisks and taking case names, but certainly alright.
You know that feeling you get when you're running a marathon and the endorphins finally kick in...
We have growth, but at the price of future jobs--all the while paying five times as much for the same car we would've bought later. What else can be done to keep up this facade of recovery? We're already printing more money than ever before. We can't raise taxes without calling it a fee, because dear leader wants to be re-elected. Can we still hit the brakes before this public-private hybrid goes into a ditch?
It's crunch time. See y'all in a month or so.
First law school midterm this monday. This one's for a third of the clams.
Happy Thanksgiving
"Life is white, and I am black. Jesus and his lawyer are coming back."

Legal research reminds me of combing the ocean floor for treasures. Every once in a while I return to the same spot with the knowledge that what I thought was a rock might have actually been an oyster with a pearl inside.
Finals begin next monday. Overhead this today in Torts: "Dude, you're fine. It's not crunch time yet."
second season of the Paper Chase is being released this December. Sweeeet.
Finals.
just began his first involuntary, five-day furlough. So sad.
Well, that was just about the longest 4 months and shortest 3 hours of my entire life. Same time next year, I hope.
is convinced, with everyone and their mother talking about the possibility of raising taxes on the middle class, it's not going to happen. Do you really think one of the most shrewd politicians since *PROPNAME* would all but certify the loss of his re-

An Obama consultant yesterday on taxing high-value, middle class health care plans: "We're not talking about a new tax on these people. We're saying they currently get an enormous tax break and we're going to slightly scale that back . . ." This will likely be the talking point for any new, middle-class taxes to come.
is going to law school. see y'all in three years.

gets to see Philip Glass as a birthday present for the second year in a row. hmm Wot's that phrase the kids use...FTW!
I thought the Kindle was a stupid idea, but the iPad...wow, this is the future of personal computing, a segue into Minority Report-like "surface computing". Way to stay ahead of the curve, Apple.
along with wife *PROPNAME*, have decided to celebrate filing their first, joint tax return in that good-old-fashioned American way, by purchasing a new TV.
How nice of the NFL to ask my favorite band to play at the Superbowl for my birthday.
loves USPS. When you underpay for online postage, they charge you at the counter. When you overpay, they pocket the difference and say "thank you". Isn't that just the Federal government in a nutshell?
is strongly considering JAG after law school. Might attend OCS over the summer.
Thanks for the birthday wishes. You guys are awesome.
*PROPNAME* is hilarious.
is 76% of the way to my goal of running three miles in eighteen minutes. Good first attempt.

R.I.P., *PROPNAME*. Maybe people will be less cruel to you where you are now.

"We would shout and swim about// The coral that lies beneath the waves.// Oh what joy for every girl and boy// Knowing they're happy and they're safe!// We would be so happy, you and me,// No one there to tell us what to do.// I'd like to be under the sea// In an octopus' garden with you." - In Memoriam Requiescat, Pater: August 16, 1962 - April 8, 2006.

There's nothing less cool than being exhausted from hours of not doing a damn thing at all.
HEY! Have you heard the news? *PROPNAME* died. NO! Say it isn't so, *PROPNAME* died.
I'm trying hard not to meet you when I'm sleeping.
Let's talk about how much fun we had about fucking the world.

There is no rest for the whiny.

is not knowing what to do with the time she has on her hands. Park, stalking squirrels? Ugh...Does anyone need to hire an assistant? Boo

loves beautiful days in NY with beautiful people, has a new temp gig starting Monday, has an interview Monday, and is pretty much loving life! xoxo
can't sleep. Wishing she was 10 years old, and not about to be 24. Misses people, misses less worries, wishes people kept promises of yesterday, wishes things were as easy as swiping a credit card in life...

thanks you so much for all the birthday wishes! She had a really amazing time :) xoxo
the best ways to get rid of Moody Mondays, and the past few days of moodiness are to talk to mom, volunteer, talk to *PROPNAME*, watch an amazing episode of Dexter, and be thankful for all the blessings in life that are free for the taking :)
squeals of little girl delight! Going home to South Florida tomorrow! Been over 6 months :)
spending her Saturday night home watching movies with Hot Cocoa. Yum!
has only 3 more days left before she gives her life away for *PROPNAME*'s Market Week...sigh..lol
has one extra day then she expected and begins her hardcore assignment Sunday, not Saturday. One day of extra rest never hurt anyone :)
- smile and the whole world smiles with you. - motivation, not desperation will get you what you want. - the only way to go is up. - family is always there for you, and having even a handful of reliable friends makes life even better :)
clocked in 14 hours today. Smiled at *PROPNAME* like a moron as she walked by...umm how was I to know what she looked like? At least I know who she is. Fashion is hard. Models are very nice though. Til next Tuesday...
wants to be like *PROPNAME* and do a monologue of all her thoughts and feelings. If only the audience were up to it. Hmmm...
had a better day than yesterday. Lack of sleep makes *PROPNAME* an unhappy girl
#&*(@^!)& &*()!&*(#^!(*)@!*( ^*!&*(
is walking on sunshine! Cold weather, hot cocoa, New Moon coming soon, good food in the tummy, and a brighter outlook on life. Yay! It is true... those things do pass, and sometimes they need a helping kick out the door. :) lol
drum roll please...76.5 hours this week of working. :) Going back in at 7:30, then it is over Tuesday..yay
is sooo happy. Things are coming together. So grateful for all the wondeful people in life that make it so great. Just so so so so happy!
had a great time in the snow, seeing "Mr. Big" with *PROPNAME*and *PROPNAME*, and is happily relaxing now...but such a pity about *PROPNAME*. Live life to the fullest :)
is going to see The Lovely Bones, cause it is already out in NYC..yay!
is still thinking about how amazing the season finale of Dexter was...wow. And is now hooked on Lost...she gets it now. Still agonizing over seeing Boone go bye bye...sexy sexy man
needs a love song that speaks of boots that take your breath away, or the sadness inside you feel when a beautiful piece of clothing costs more than a teeth cleaning. No more of this stuff about wishing a guy//girl would love you. How about wishing you had a place to wear a $3,000 gown? Could afford a $3,000 gown? :)
is sharing the secrets of the best products she has used lately. The InStyler- amazing hair, even with light mist outdoors. Urban Decay Primer Potion- I rub my eyes a lot and it still stays (wish it worked for mascara). Forever Makeup Aqua Eyes- gorgeous colors you will get tons of compliments, and it stays! Love to all :)
is happy for the new year and is excited for all the wonderful things that are here now and are in the future :) xoxo
is having one of those days, but thankfully has come to the realization that moments do pass and tomorrow is a new day and the problems of this week will be a faded memory when next week comes around.

had delicious Thai food, needs to clean tomorrow, and is excited about getting busy at her new job
is looking at old photos...and is kinda glad she takes them off facebook every so often, so that she has them all to herself, and it helps her make sure she keeps moving forward  ;)
is pondering...how many people pop up on your facebook homepage you can barely recall having talked to in the last year? Hmmm....life it changes
is lost, but in 2010 hopefully she will find her way and is making a promise to put herself first :)
ugh that *PROPNAME* has the face of a nightmare...ewww
wants to be like the cute old couple on third avenue who sit outside, rain or shine, together happily watching people walk by...
has been a negative person this week, and although the week is not up yet she will turn it around. Looking for hope to ward off the restlessness
black
wants to pose a question...if you could go back to several times in your life you wish you could do differently would you?
is happy things are coming together for her job and self-wise...is a lot busier than she realized...feels good about keeping her resolution to be selfish to herself...and is letting other people make the effort, and it is great :)
is sleepy, loves *PROPNAME*'s new blog, *PROPNAME*'s remodeled blog, *PROPNAME*'s new makeup, and is so pumped for New Moon!!! Did she mention she has the new CD and loves it?
used to like facebook more, but it just is not the same...maybe it is time to change things up...
is fulfilled in life! Is sooooo excited for everything! :)
is sleepy, is sooo happy and content, is so lucky to have the many wonderful people she has in her life, and is really happy to have the opportunity to have work in such a crazy economy :)
has a bump on her head she has no idea where it came from, loves the cold weather, feels like a weight has been lifted from her, and is confident in her choices here on out.

Reality check.  We are fortunate.  Prayers for Haiti.

Anyone interested in training for the Cville 10 miler with me?
To CTYers past and present, I urge you to do two things: 1) Dust off your Garden State soundtrack, there was a reason we listened to it non-stop for 42 days. 2) Mark July 16-18 in your calendar - we are all descending on the land of milk and honey.  Carlizzle fo' shizzle.
My FB font is huge - regular size on every other program - what did I do?  Help!
Inside Edition has hit an all time low.  Lead story: Will the crisis in Haiti affect the Golden Globe Awards?
Blame it on the a a a a a applejuice. Blame it on the a a a a a applejuice.
The lady at Panera didn't even have to ask me my name today. It showed up on my receipt - spelled correctly.  Maybe I need to hit up Greenberry's for a little bit.
Anyone have a gently-used treadmill they'd like to sell?

Thank goodness my voice is back.  :-)  Shabbat Shalom everyone!
I've officially booked an October flight to New York to visit my future husband.  :-)
Lesson planning and creating a calendar for the school year... hard to believe I will be teaching already on Sunday.
No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. No one should be unable to change jobs because of a "pre-existing condition." If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day.
Shabbat Shalom!
I hate the fact that I currently have no computer.  It is not fun to have to borrow other people's computers.
I am thankful for webcams.  It is nice to be able to see my fiance online while he is in New York.  :-)
I'm liking my new desktop computer and thankful that it is not giving me any grief thus far.  :-) Shanah Tovah (Happy Jewish New Year)!
To all my Jewish friends: Gemar chatimah tovah.- May your final sealing (in the Book of Life) be good.
Enjoyed spending the weekend with my love.  Now it is back to the grind.

Can't wait until Friday morning when I'll be in my fiance's arms.  :-)
Contemplating the Forms and Plato's utopian society as I write my paper on Plato.  Please note that I do not actually agree with Plato's ideas, but I find them fascinating.
I am getting less and less sleep due to midterms.  :-(
I'm so excited about my upcoming trip to New York!  :-)  I leave Thursday night on a red eye.
Please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who is gay. My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease: people who are gay are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE.
I see the light at the end of the tunnel!  Liturgy take home final due Friday and last but not least, Philosophy of Education paper to complete during Winter Break.
I hate having laryngitis as a songleader.  I want to be able to do my job, but I can't.  :-(
Now that *PROPNAME* has returned to New York, I am finally working on completing my philosophy of Jewish education paper.  It is pleasant to do school work after two weeks of rest, relaxation, and fun.  :-)

is missing *PROPNAME* (and *PROPNAME*)
feels so blessed by her church family...there couldn't be a better church to serve than Calvary!
has too much to do in too little time. Why is the "to-do" list getting longer every day instead of shorter?

is ringing in the new year with a bowl of Kix & a glass of water & Wii golf.  yeah...i'm cool. ; )
just saw a tragic//comedic drama - August: Osage County - and thought it was intensely true and devastating and redemptive and isolating and packed with anger, hurt, joy, confusion, misunderstandings, and innocent deceptions. This family could be the centerpiece of a dissertation on family systems theory!
is still sick...first time to miss christmas eve services...good thing i have great colleagues...
is relaxing with *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, & *PROPNAME*...and *PROPNAME* is showing me pictures of Boston and making me sad...

sad about the loss of the elephant calf at the Memphis Zoo:(
would like to know why our water is off
is doing some major housecleaning!
didn't think that coming to take care of the water heater first thing in the morning meant 11...I guess there's still 45 mins until it afternoon!
just had a wonderful chat with *PROPNAME* on the phone and is about to start making dinner:)
went to see "The Hangover" tonight then came home to enjoy a nice relaxing jacuzzi tub bath with a glass of wine...life doesn't get much better than that!
For once I meant to let my phone battery die all the way before recharging and did I remember to plug it in once it reached that point? Not until just now...oops
is making rice krispies treats!
Is excited to have 2 more new books from Paperback swap but can't decide what to read now!
is annoyed that GM decided it would be cool to have some stupid ass bracket for wiper blades on the G6 resulting in me having to pay $70 for replacement blades.
had a good workout at the gym this afternoon, just took a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath and now off to bed with fresh from the dyer sheets. Ahhhhh fantastic:)
The first 2 Atlantic tropical storms, *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*, have formed. I'm not too worried but have to admit there's a little unease about the idea of something making it here. Afterall, this is my first rodeo!
*PROPNAME* and her friend are coming to visit me next weekend!!! So excited!!!
had a great day with a wonderful friend and a wonderful evening with a great boyfriend. I'm one lucky girl:)
Sometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f**k was going on when I first saw it.
is nervous about getting cavities filled for the first time ever tomorrow:( The up side is that it probably isn't as bad as repair work from stepping on a shovel;) There I feel a bit better now!
is excited about dinner and movie date night:)
How many times is it appropriate to say "What?" before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear what they said?
*PROPNAME* brought me breakfast in bed this morning, hanging out with *PROPNAME* later, then a delicious pineapple pork chop dinner made by *PROPNAME* and watching a movie..what a great day it's going to be!:D
If *PROPNAME* San Diego and *PROPNAME* ever got together, their offspring would probably just be completely invisible.
is trying to decide what to stock the fridge with so there is a chance that *PROPNAME* will eat something besides fast food for 5 days that I'm gone! :)
is a huge nerd and posting books on paperback swap:)
Bad news: Novocaine is wearing off so my mouth is hurting a bit now. Good news: I can now drink my pumpkin spice latte without dribbling:)
is glad that we waited to watch Wolverine as a rental.
is wondering how many people get themselves screwed out of money by not paying attention and keeping records of stuff. I just added another $70 to my "um no dumby actually I don't owe you that money" total. Yay me:)
I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes.
"You try growing up in a trailer park with nothing but dust mites and Lithuanians and see where that gets you"..a line from a terrible movie on netflix on demand, but it made me giggle
is off to the gym!
is feeling productive after posting *PROPNAME*'s care on autotrader. If anyone is possibly interested in a 2006 Honda Civic Si for ~$13500 let me know. I will post the link too once it's officially up on the site!
off to the store to get the things I need to make caramel apple cookies. I hope that mine turn out as good as the picture! I also hope that they have the caramel bits I need at this Walmart!
is wondering what the heck? Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool.
Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit
had a busy day. Time for a nap before possibly carving pumpkins this evening:)
perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :)
Happy Halloween! Almost timet to make some snacks for the party tonight:)
Carving pumpkins with *PROPNAME*...pictures to come soon:)
shooting and punching some stuff in Borderlands:)
just heard a commercial on the radio about some pill to lower cholesterol. They actually said "Do you have high cholesterol due to poor diet or lack of exercise? Then you need to try this"  No, actually you need to try improving your diet and exercising a bit first.  Just a crazy thought I had...
is happy that my new hard drive is installed. Yay!
is pretty sure I'm coming down with whatever *PROPNAME* considering I just folded a load of towels and now feel completely drained.  The good news is that the TV is working again:)

is making some grub
is not happy that our A//C is not working. Grrrr
just finished watching "The Ugly Truth", cute movie:)

just finished watching " Dear Zachary: a letter from a father to his son". It was a pretty good documentary but very emotional...I suggest having tissues nearby
plans to sit on the couch watching movies all day.
almost time to make white chicken chili with cheddar jalepeno hushpuppy crust. It's going to be even better than usual 'cause we finally have some fall weather here!
just saw a commercial for Rihanna's 20//20 interview about her ordeal with *PROPNAME*...isn't it convenient that she is finally able to talk about it in an interview aired the day after her new album comes out?
is watching "The Proposal". *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*...even if the movie is crap it won't be a total waste:)
is excited about my helicopter shaped cookie cutter:)
mmm peppermint mocha coffee creamer:)
doing some online Christmas shopping
doesn't know what to make of the fact that based on my interest in TV shows like "Brotherhood" and "Californication" , Netflix has a recommendations section of other "Dysfunctional family dramas"  This includes "Dexter" and "Rescue Me" which are both shows I watch. Oh Netflix you know me so well.
is not sure what the repairman fiddled with yesterday to get some warm air to come out of the heater for a while but I'm pretty sure that the heat is still not working quite right considering that after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set to 72 it is still only 65 in my house and there is cool..no cold air blasting out of the vents...and yes it is on heat not AC;)
wasn't very impressed with "Taking of Pelham 123" although I was amused by *PROPNAME*'s character talking about the girl he took to Iceland..a Lithuanian ass model named Lavitika.  Ha
is happy to have a new working DirecTV box. I can open the guide and switch channels without it freezing....and the DVR works. I can now go back to waiting until a few minutes into a show before I start watching and then fast forward through commercials!
is getting very excited about decorating for Christmas! We are heading out to get a tree and all that fun stuff in a while:)
is off to the gym again. I tried and can't think of a valid reason not to go, plus my legs aren't sore are at all from yesterday. I will will thank myself for this later:)
is happily watching Pixar short films on abc family while my DVR records *PROPNAME* on another channel:) Oh and I'm drinking my pumpkin spice coffee too! Life is good!
Happy Thanksgiving everybody! I'm thankful for friends to share Thanksgiving with:) Now time to make some yummy food to share later
is making spaghetti sauce. Yum!
has a cold and is curled up on the couch resting.
blue
Thanks for all the birthday wishes yesterday! I had a great day:)
can't believe it. I got the new Wii Fit Plus game, it has a lot of fun new games and features. However, after not using the wii fit for a few months we decided to do the fitness test stuff again. Me(since last time): +2.9 lbs, still a healthy weight and BMI, wii age 54. *PROPNAME*: -8.6lbs, reccommends a healthy weight of gaining 6lbs, wii age 32. On the positive side, I have lost 5 of the 8 lbs I gained over the holidays!
was annoyed with the state of LA for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on 11//20//2009 even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent...oh and it took them 2 months to do something about it. My grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at Progressive. She was friendly and talkative, like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials. Thanks *PROPNAME*!
is taking *PROPNAME* to the vet for her annual check-up. I know it's good for her I just always feel a bit bad because she hates it so much :(
Dear Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles employees, I understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid, annoying people on a regular basis.  That doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone, especially not the friendly people like me darn it!
did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house.
Funny: Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said "Yes that's G as in...(10 second lapse)..ummm...Goonies"
has recooped from working out and has caught a cleaning bug!
is making sweet potatoe split pea soup. I hope it's good!
can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo!
why oh why do I let myself watch animal cops shows? I just end up feeling a mix of sadness for the animals and almost rage towards the people involved.
set my calorie goal for wii fit tonight as a piece of fried chicken....turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken!
was enjoying my morning shower until one of those stupid Saints remixes came on the radio. I'm all for that kind of thing when I actually go to games, but I'm sick of hearing it in regular rotation on the radio.
A bit mean...but damn funny Sarchasm : The gulf between the author of  sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it.
is watching a movie:)
just finished playing wii fit plus and burned an ice cream cone worth of calories. Now it's ok for me to eat an ice cream right? Kidding:)
accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone!
The feminine version of the name *PROPNAME* meaning "the woman." Basically never printed on magnets, mugs or other souvenir paraphernalia. Often mistaken for *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME* or *PROPNAME*. My name is *PROPNAME*, not *PROPNAME*, dammit. (Urbandictionary.com, type in your first name, copy and paste the first entry)
is off to bed and hoping not to be woken up by things flapping and crashing from the crazy wind outside. On the up side it's going to be in the 60-70 range for the next week!:)
feels bad for my sick boyfriend. I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames!
thinks it might be time for a nap:)
is off to work out. I don't want to but it's been 3 days:(
doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:)
starting to make some delicious snacks to enjoy while watching the Superbowl later
is home from the Lockport Mardi Gras parade and is ready for a nap!
really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math. I don't appreciate getting rather large bills for amounts that BSBC and I have already paid. Oh and thanks for putting it in the 120 day slot so I get to stress about further stupidity on your part resulting in a bad outcome for me.

drunk MSU fans when I was biking home after the game: "oh, band fag coming through" I don't like to swear, but I had to bite my tongue to keep from either flicking them off or just simply saying "FUCK YOU!"
today I saw an old woman walking across the bridge by Sparty. She was wearing a bright aqua colored shirt. Right behind her was a college guy wearing a t-shirt of the exact same hue. It made me smile! :P

. iphone 3.0 release a DAY LATE? FU!
<3 *PROPNAME*'s ginger candy.
is mad that the fair ended up being more about mud than anything else.
is mad that the store was out of wonton rolls. DO NOT FRY SPRINGROLL WRAPPERS. It will not work.
Motorola S305!!!
s gf likes everything, apparently.
Set up a mobile router. Was way easier than I thought it would be.
is a bad person.
s world is rocked with the ht820.
is amazed out how more effective individual updates are at getting rid of his possessions than a single photo album. Only two more pieces of furniture to go!
finally remembers the meaning of summertime Friday nights.
had an awesome 4th.
I talked to a guy today who was convinced chemical engineering was "mixing elements to make things that use chemicals." Might make more sense if he didn't mean it literally. Oh well.
Who wants free stuff? The more I get rid of, the less I have to move. Dresser? Coat Rack? Shelves? Desk? Bathroom Stereo? Really people, you're doing me a favor by just taking it.
just set up network printing even though everyone said it was impossible. HA!
Who wants a FREE TV? Please just come and take it!!!
I'm still mad that I got into Jazz Band (the good one even) but I can't do it because of Thermo. THIS IS THE FIRST TEMR OF COLLEGE I WILL NOT GET TO PLAY MUSIC. GRAWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!

<3s feeding time at the aquarium.

Westbound on the Mass Pike you see signs for Springfield and Albany; almost like being in Oregon.
Next term I'll have a lab and get to do SCIENCE every day. Until then I have a cube and get to do HOMEWORK every day.
No, I'm sorry; a manometer is not a device that goes off when *PROPNAME* is nearby.
sure hopes Venture Bros. goes into season 5.
If you split a raw almond in your mouth, the halves are completely smooth on the inside. Why does this never lose its novelty?
thought everyone might like to know he was voted biggest nerd out of all the ChEs...
Damn feeder valve keeps clogging.
LHC: 2 beams WOOOOOO!
Whaaaat? I actually liked Avatar?
I find it frustrating when non friends post pictures of friends; it leaves me without the option of leaving snarky comments. *grumble*
It'll take a lot of convincing before I'll even THINK about watching Caprica. Reimagined Battlestar can KMA. I might change my mind if the writters demonstrate they're capable of keeping the plot details straight through the whole series. Thoughts anyone?
I highly reccommend *PROPNAME*. *PROPNAME* rules.
Woot. One craigslist adventure down; one to go!
wonders why more people don't say "twenty ten"
Damn boxcutter.

Why is it impossible to sit in the tub with the shower on and not feel emo?
Wow, campus eye doctor is really fast. Go UMass!

: saved by Wolfram Alpha.

just played Quidditch.  It was awesome.
Holy Crap!  *PROPNAME*'s has a rewards program that lets you get a free chocolate from the store every month!  How awesome is that?
starts his job tomorrow.  Goodbye Freetimesville, hello Moneytown Station!
can't help but smile.
is liking the new job so far.  Of course, the kids have yet to arrive...
is my name and I'm here to say, I have the symptoms of an awesome day!

is about to lead an activity on Dating Etiquette...wish me luck.
is sad the weekend is here...  Can't wait for Sunday, 7pm.
is going to nuke the site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.

thinks he'll start a Prussia-style diary, and this status update will remind him of his choice until he finally acts upon it.
is currently preptastic.
Hey my Rhode Island friends.  What rocks to do in Providence and what's the best Italian place in the city?
is sick of starting letters with "dear."  My friends are more than dear, I'm using different adjectives from now on.  "Anti-Establishment *PROPNAME*, how are you?  Signed, *PROPNAME*."  Screw you, convention!
is done!  Hooray!
wants to be asleep and isn't.  Damn you, not-terrible work ethic!
is going to a research reactor tomorrow, yay!
is thinking tonight of his old college town...
is all set for tomorrow!
is impressed that the ads on the side of FB are getting relevant without being offensively so...finally.  I've got an ad for a book I like, a band I like, and a movie by an animator I like.  Yay!
grew bolder day by day.
wants a cottage cheese and pastrami sandwich on banana bread, even if it severely ruins your reputation!
wishes everyone a happy first day of classes yayyyyyyy!
had a great day off...
is a doctor, not a writer of witty status updates, damnit!
doesn't want to say goodbye next week.  : (
finds fiction much more interesting when you imagine the same actors and voice actors to be the same people instead of different characters.  Holy crap, *PROPNAME*'s father is Liquid Snake!  Hey look, Obi-Wan Kenobi is helping Don Quixote liberate the Arabs in WWI!
wishes all of his Cornellian friends good luck tomorrow!  Enjoy it, it's a wonderful place.
wants to see a version of that *PROPNAME* story "Gift of the Magi" where one of the people receives a Bible, only to inform their friend that they sold their soul to Satan to buy them their gift.
knows he wants to be Canadian, please.

loved *PROPNAME*!

had a MUCH better first day of classes than he expected.
wishes he were in Ithaca.  : (
is getting better at resisting the urge to Ragequit.
is in love with a girl named *PROPNAME*...  Damn that stuff is delicious.
wishes he and his friends could burst into random song and dance like in musicals...
looks a lot more like a young Lenin with his ushanka than he ever realized.
recently realized there's a large whole in his theoretical structure of life.  It may be a few interations before he has a working solution.
is one iteration closer to his desired solution.
wonders whether anyone's ever done an etymological history of onomatopoeia.  Why did "oink" become so popular when most pigs I've seen go "reeee"?  Why did "fap" become so popular?  Is it accuracy or something else?  A most interesting question...  Any linguistics majors in need of a paper topic?
never gives up, never surrenders!
is feeling rather Odinesque today...in a Ragnarok sorta way.
is enjoying Chicago immensely.  If only time were passing a little more slowly.
wants to thank the Tabasco company for listing the Scoville Heat Units of its products, and thinks all spicy food makers should follow suit.
wishes he were in Ithaca.  They get snow...
just hit a wall of work.
thinks he's going to make truffles tomorrow...FOR SCIENCE!
has finally started orientation!  Seems pretty good so far.
has finally ended orientation!  That was fast...  Perspectives in Social Science, Historical Methods, and Early Modern England will be my classes this quarter, it seems.
gave up on being a productive member of society when he left engineering, OK Social Sciences?  Just let me write about cool people.  I don't want to think about how my topic benefits anyone.
loves Holst oh so much.
PONY!
feels like a koala crapped a rainbow in his brain!
gazed upon the face of the Savior of the Monkeys and wept from the beauty of the sight.
is done with the MAPSS midterm and much happier because of it.
thinks he'll apply to Pigfarts for next year.
leaves for Chicago tomorrow.  Can't wait!  Now if only the magical packing fairy would visit me...
associates Russian classical composers with Christmas, for some reason.  Not just the Nutcracker stuff, either.  It's a bit odd...  Especially since everyone knows Santa lives in Finland, not Russia.
just found out Megas XLR is on iTunes!  Life just got a little bit more awesome.
is ready to begin his day fueled with the power of french toast!  Readings: prepare to be read...
has too many unknowns to solve his equations, but he'll never stop trying.
digs giant robots.
Dear everyone: crack open a dictionary and start using "hypothesis" and "theory" correctly from now on.  It's not that hard, and misusing the word confuses stupid people to whom I then need to listen, which makes me sad.  : (
lernas Esperanton!
has chourico!  The tastiest, most delicious meat known to mankind!  And I'm going to eat the crap out of it!
amas lerni novaj lingvoj!
is thankful for all his wonderful friends!  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  I wish I could spend it with every one of you.
Alright Holst, listen up.  I'm going to see your music tomorrow and I don't want anything supernatural to prevent it, got it?  I'm sick of your crap.
danced again last night.  This is starting to become a pattern...
remembers a time when he was able to easily find classes because the school actually had its shit together and managed to have a central location with all the course descriptions.
Good morning!  And in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
reads from his past and mourns the future.
"I love her better than anybody here, and see her seldomer.  So it often happens in the world."-*PROPNAME*
has finished his skeleton drafts, hooray!  Suck it, essays!
HAL is alive once again!  Just in time for 2010, conveniently enough.  Not sure if I'm gonna keep him, cuz he's now missing MS Word, but eh, he has internet.
s ganache is delicious.
Dear Online Dictionary Makers, Let people search the text of the entries, not just the entry words.  Make your dictionaries more like a human brain.  Let me search "make things the same" and find words that include those words in their definitions.  That would rock. Love, *PROPNAME*
I have enemies?  I thought these things always just happened...
feels weird being in the library during Finals Week as a patron...
Holy crap this is hilarious: http:////www.standforchristmas.com//pages//home Just read these reviews.  What bigoted morons think like this?  Read the "Offensive" ones.  They're the best.
is starting to wonder whether his eyes reflect light in the near-infrared spectrum or something that's just out of sight for humans but visible to cameras, cuz man, if I only had photos to go by I would swear my eyes are red.
And now all I have to do is pack!  Hooray!  One quarter down, two to go!
is filling his diaries with references to dinosaurs and Bigfoot.  This way, when the world ends and future historians have only my diary for primary sources, they'll think that at least the world was awesome before it ended.  If you care about tricking the future into believing our era was the awesomest ever, I encourage you to do the same.  Together, we can do it!
I'm home, wheee!
One paper submitted, two to go.
RIP HAL 9000...  I think your successor will be named Metal Gear.
has the most melodramatic sister in the world...
just got his mind blown.  Apparently *PROPNAME* from Salute Your Shorts, the rich girl, was played by a Chinese-American actress.  I totally never noticed that.  Ever.  Thank you, www.tvtropes.org for once again, showing that I have a terrible memory.
is beginning to miss Chicago and his friends there...
dreads his mortality as he walks the empty aisles of a library, admiring the volumes, yet knowing his life will never last long enough for him to enjoy them all.
Let's see how honest MY FB friends are. Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me. It can only be one word. No more than one word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. This should be interesting...
wants to get out of Hyde Park.
wants to be the very best!  Like no one ever was!
A bit of Christmas cuteness: http:////www.watchanimeon.com//axis-powers-hetalia-ii-episode-28//
should just become a chef.
wonders whether love can bloom, even on a battlefield.
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Well crap.  My computer's software is currently corrupted or something and won't work.  Right before my two Hell Weeks begin.  Wheeee...  Anyone in Chicago have a copy of their Windows XP Professional edition CD I can borrow to reinstall stuff?
Is back in Chicago!
s New Year's Resolution is to negate everyone else's resolutions.
27F, feels like 14F....Ah!  It's like being in Ithaca again!  It feels wonderful!  And yes, *PROPNAME*, I am crazy.
Just did the research and writing for his 12 page term paper in 48 hours.  Revision time!
All three of my sidebar ads are currently about meeting girls.  I think Facebook pities me...  :(
returns to Chicago tomorrow!  Yay!
First day of classes for a new quarter!  I hope no suddenly loud girls give me coronary thrombosis like last quarter...
has the same Spring Break as *PROPNAME*!  If any Cornellians want a super awesome place to visit during their Spring Break, keep Chicago in mind...
has a few excellent weekends coming up.  Rock on!
Happy 150th Birthday, Mr Zamenhof!  Thanks for the language!
The Portuguese pronounce X like SH?  Damnit, is it THEIR fault Romanized Chinese does the same?  I always wondered who to blame for that.
wonders whether Professor *PROPNAME* would let him write a term paper on fanfictions using theories from the readings...
Welche bluse magst du lieber, diese oder diese?
Holy mother microfilm is a bitch on the eyes.  Dear 1890, learn to write normal Ms and Ns.  Yours look like Ws and Us.
Come on Massachusetts!  You guys are supposed to be New English!  What happened?
Anyone wanna see The Fly on Wednesday?  It'll be awesome...
just had a great day.
Geez 18th Century Britons, if you love *PROPNAME* the Great so much, why don't you just marry him?
Holy crap!  Hiero II of Syracuse was a former general of Pyrrhus of Epirus!  I never knew that!  Hiero has the official title of Awesomest Friendhaver in the Ancient World now, so far as I'm concerned.  Pyrrhus and Archimedes, at least!  Go Hiero!  You're MY hero!
Can't wait for next weekend, even if he is getting evaluated!
You can ask me one question (Send it to my inbox). Any question- anything. No matter how awkward it can be I'll answer it honestly, no catch. But, I dare you to put this as your status and see what people ask you.  (I can't resist dares...)
Off to the art museum!  Sorry Proposal, I'll work on you later...probably...
Whutta whutta whutta whutta...
wishes a Happy Valentine's Day to all those for whom he cares!  I hope all my friends know how much they mean to me!
Is looking forward to the weekend.
Is off to see *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*!  And I got an awesome gift in the mail today!  And I learned how to construct a book wheel.  Today is just, like, mega-awesome!
I guess this is our last goodbye | And you don't care, so I wont cry | But you'll be sorry when I'm dead | And all this guilt will be on your head | I guess you'd call it suicide | But I'm too full to swallow my pride.
R.I.P MJ
<3 Sumir.
RIP *PROPNAME*...
Walked out this morning, dont believe what I saw | A Hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore | Seems Im not alone at being alone | A Hundred billion castaways, looking for a home...
You always knew just how to make me cry | And never did I ask you questions why | It seems you get your kicks from hurting me | Don't try to understand me | Because your words just aren't enough | Love is a feeling | Give it when I want it | Quench my des
Tokyo.
went out for dinner with a man who just happened to be a host.  True story.
Hey all!  My American Phone is officially off!  Don't call or text it anymore, k?
And we can live in a beautiful world hide away under peaceful skies. We can survive on time and a word feel the nights passing by.
I've finally gotten around to uploading all of my Japan pictures so far.  I know there are an unbelievable amount of them (forgive me, I love taking pics), but enjoy them!
ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each others pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third.
missed teaching at the elementary school Thursday...  -sad-
wants to fall in love~
Woke up late and didn't get to eat breakfast today -sad- I'm so hungry...
I want someone to buy me dinner.
"The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters."
I always make it a rule to let the other fellow fire first.  If a man wants to fight, I argue the question with him and try to show him how foolish it would be.  If he can't be dissuaded, why then the fun begins but I always let him have first crack.  Then when I fire, you see, I have the verdict of self-defence on my side.  I know that he is pretty certain in his hurry, to miss.  I never do.
I want to be loved, but you don't seem to love me | I'm wandering aimlessly within this repetition | And the answer I found is only one; that even if I'm scared, even if I'm hurt | I'll say "I love you" to the person I love
So bored.
????? ???????? ???????? You and I ???? ??????? ????? ???????????? ???????? I want to see you right now! Even though I want to shout it. I no longer can say you and I Even if I try to force it. I cant catch you Back then you used to be in my armsBut youre gone now.
is missing you.

"I have a ship and a fighting crew and a girl with lips like wine, and that's all I ever asked.  Lick your wounds, bullies, and break out a cask of ale.  You're going to work ship as she never was worked before.  Dance and sing while you buckle to it, damn you! To the devil with empty seas! We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!"
Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes wonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous. They make men extremely rich or extremely poor. They make or break men. I always feel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life. I believe I am happy because I am not ambitious.
Like fire, Hellfire,  This fire in my skin.        This burning, desire,         Is turning me to sin.  | It's not my fault; I'm not to blame.   It is the gypsy girl; The witch who sent this flame  | It's not my fault; If in God's plan.  He made the devil so much stronger than a man
La~st Christmas, I gave you my heart.  The very next day, you gave it away... This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.
I hope the survivors in Haiti receive aid quickly...
I will be in Tokyo on the 10th!  Anyone want to entertain//be entertained by me while I'm there?
I like Asahi Super Dry... very much.
Your face.
Slowly walking down the hall, Faster than a cannonball~  Where were you while we were getting high? Someday you will find me, Caught beneath the landslide, In a champagne supernova in the sky~~~

is thanking God for another day in the land of the living. For tomorrow is not promised. A harsh reminder that we have a limited time to mend broken relationships achieve our goals and be with the ones we love.
is BACK! AND BETTER THAN EVER!!!! A little wiser a lot stronger and much happier with a NEW ATTITUDE! :-)
is lovin it! All I have to do is sit back, enjoy the ride, let the good times roll and my destiny is HERE. Yep, pretty much! :-)
is so disappointed...why do I always have to be right about these things?
knows that God is carrying her. Without Him this would be too much. "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life. (Proverbs 4:23) Lord, I know your love is enough for me. :-)
"If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way...I hope life treats you kind. And I hope you have all you dreamed of. And I wish you joy and happiness but above this I wish you love....And I 
"Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouths speaks". Guard your words at all times. Your mouth can do so much damage to you and those around you. "The tongue is a world of iniquity, set afire of hell."
Word of the day: You don't have to settle for anything or anyone in your life. Determine what you don't like, pray hard, work hard, and fix it. Sometimes its just easier to walk away and start over.
is saying Lord take my hand, cover me and take me beyond what I understand.
is thinking that some people, once gone, need not EVER come back into your life...EVER.
is wondering why people think I'm going to put up with their foolishness. My silence IS NOT ignorance. YES, my price tag is HIGH, but the rewards FAR EXCEED THE COSTand those who matter will put in the work. The only treasure valued is the treasure worked for.
is finally doing what she should have done a long time ago. A burden has been lifted.
is SO HAPPY that my daddy ALWAYS hears and answers right on time!!! I LOVE MY JESUS and He's the only one that I need!
I got exactly what I asked for and it hurts. I forgot that nightmares are dreams, too.
is really craving some bbq! :-( I love my family but something's gonna have to change....
is starting all over again....
can see clearly now and no longer focuses on the closed doors. I'm only looking at all the open ones God has set before me. "Surely or ONLY goodness, mercy, and unfailing love shall follow me ALL THE DAYS of my life and the presence of the Lord and His house shall be my dwelling place forever."
"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is GOD that justifieth...For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Have a blessed day!
is lmbo as this last Uno game I just played! But really, though? Time for bed, long day tomorrow.
is comforted and content. It only gets better from here!
had dinner with one of her favorite teachers and is FINALLy home....
People come and go and will always disappoint so I only invest in God. Lord, I belong to you until the end of time. I just wanna be close to you.
Two weddings, one baby shower and a great church service on Sunday! A weekend full of love and encouragement and I know the best is yet to come! "All things work together for the good to them that love God, for them who are the called according to his purpose."
"And still, I rise."
is excited about her first day at her NEW JOB as a college graduate! This is gonna be a FABULOUS DAY! This is the day that the LORD hath made, let us REJOICE and be glad in it!
finally graudated, despite the weather. Thank you, Jesus. And thank you all for your love and support and thanks to my love who came out to celebrate with me last night!

is looking to hire an end user support technician.
feels niceness is wasted on some people
wants some Alertos to cure this hangover
talking to the two little guys standing on my shoulders about the iPhone
The best winter holiday season of my life has concluded

24 hours til lift off
is excited for July 3rd.
is rather enjoying her little vacation in Oshkosh.
Is getting married in a little over a month
isn't sure what to think about things.
is waiting for August 28th at 4:15. Horray for the beginning of the rest of my life!
has cold feet.
is terribly confused. It feels like my mind is warring with itself...
is thinking hard and excited for her new Xanga layout!
thinks pipe tobacco is way better than cigarettes.
doesn't know how to cope with all of this stress... I think I've cried about 10 times in the last 3 days...
continues to befuddle herself.
was NOT able to push her wedding date back to the fourth of September. The presiding judge was full-up. The date remains August 28th at 4:15.
is sick.....still. And possibly jobless in 2 weeks. That is, if no more positions open up for me at Wal-mart.
hopes that wal-mart hires her, now realizing her blouse was open during part of the interview.
maybe a kitty would be a good christmas gift for *PROPNAME*....
still getting over that cold from last week.... but hey at least everyone's laid off the "quit smoking!" bit....
is at home on her first scheduled day off. And I'm bored out of my mind.
is still rather fluish.
is thinking that the poor girls doing that "single ladies" are getting dissed too much. I've seen younger girls doing lewder dances with less clothes. Seriously.
would work a spell if not for the moon being void of course...
is sick and tired of people who comment on every SINGLE status update, no matter how INSIGNIFICANT. We've been here before, you know who you are.
is having a little boy!
bought her 2010 Farmer's Almanac today.... horray for not having to write down every single sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and void of course pattern for next year! wOOt!
stayed home from work to take care of her hubby. By the way, the yorkie babies are so ADORABLE!
thinks that she needs some numbers from friends.
needs someone to drink for her on Dec. 12th since I'm pregnant and can't... lol
6 more days.... I'm counting down! And bah on all you snow-haters. All I know is I don't have to shovel this year, thanks to my loving hubby. Thank you hubby :)
is still sick. Oh well.
hm, low-signal internet? works for me.
I don't want to miss this weekend, but i might have to.... shitty weather and my hubby can't work today.... I think I might cry cause I really, REALLY wanted to go..... why did I ask for snow? I only wanted a little!
Finally! Snow in Reedsburg. I'm so happy there's gonna be snow on my birthday!
just woke up to half an inch of snow and is so happy, she's going outside in her pajamas to sweep it off her porch! That's no sarcasm folks..... I'm really excited. :) 5 days!
is a little upset about the amount of snow, and hopes she gets enough birthday money to visit her parents this weekend.
Well, Reedsburg certainly has an interesting way of plowing the streets..... 2 more days.
feels 8 months pregnant.... but really I'm only 5 1//2.....
wonders if its just coincidence that mine and my best friend's birthdays are EXACTLY twoo weeks apart.
Classes start 1//26 at 1:30 pm. I'm so excited!
is eating stroganoff, waiting for her hubby to come home and then maybe some sleep.
6 more days.... I'm counting down!
The siren in Reedsburg keeps going off. It's not the normal noonblast siren, it sounds like an air-raid siren and continued for 10 minutes. Can anyone tell me how to find out what the damn things mean?
SLEEP>WAKE UP>EAT>MORE WALLS AND FLOORS!
wishes vampire wars didn't take so long to put monies and energy back to your character.
TAPS then bed....
Sends out yuletide greetings to all her friends! I love you all and have a very merry holiday!
More walls! More floors! I need to make the sims 2 even more amazing!!!!
Hopes no one else bought a baby book for *PROPNAME*... I'm up to three now!
Going to grandma b's for dinner, then to sheboygan falls tomorrow... .what a busy weekend

Greatly dislikes the USPS. They damaged my christmas card :(
4 days folks, then up to mercer with my son and my loving hubby. I love you, hubby :)
Had a wonderiferous birthday. :)
is drowsy still... at least I managed to get 8 hours of sleep last night... a rarity these days.
found out The Used put out a new album this past year. How did I miss that one?
is a little upset about not being able to get a good connection all day. I'll try again tonight....
Cody's car is GHEY.
work on the forum is done for today..... now time to get lunch for me, connor and the baby and watch Wall-E again.....
going to be another long and boring week. So glad i don't have to go anywhere for a few months after this weekend.
Wishes she could post her awesome playlist to gaia but can't figure out the coding for it.
actually got some good sleep for once :)
knows what connor got from her.... he is such a little drama king, screaming bloody murder at time-outs!
sleepy...... >.> Working on the forum.
ugh... i hate this. Why is sleep such an issue when you're pregnant?
hates facebook, the internet, and her monitor.
is unloved <//3
hopes they schedule her C-Section at her doctor's appointment on Wednesday.
Tommorrow, I turn 21. I'm super excited. And I can't wait for 4 pm to roll around..... Mercer, here I come!
It never fails... I go to lay my son down for a nap and someone inevitably begins pounding on something, making it impossible for him to sleep.
They got me.... those darn Zynga games..... so addicting.....
3//3//10 *PROPNAME* is coming!
i need a massage. Now. Any takers?
I should have gone to bed earlier than 1:30 am..... guess I forgot that *PROPNAME* was going to be up at 7....
hubby is sick, connor is crabby..... I'm just tired.
finally found out who got her hubby and kid sick... and is pissed that she didn't find out until her son started puking.
has discovered that is an AWFUL idea to sleep on her back.
Getting my son to take a nap is like pulling teeth.
well, my kid and *PROPNAME* are better now..... just waiting for it to hit me...
I WANNA PLAY GF!
I think my part of the RP forum is done... we will need some moderators so anyone interested please send a meassage to me on here and I will get you set up with an account and send a linky.... thanks!
Pali Tank FTW!
absolutely HAS to remember to call MATC and drop her class.
I'll be back tomorrow, I'll be back at a quarter to eleven. I'm half drunk and I can't see straight, I hear a zero with a capital "Z". You got me singing songs from the balcony as the city crumbles under the powers of an evil doctor rocket science monster with capabilities to destroy the entire universe.
PANTS ON THE GROUND! PANTS ON THE GROUND! LOOKING LIKE A FOOL WITH YOUR PANTS ON THE GROUND!
sleepy.......
TAX REFUND!
City of Angels hads reconfirmed my belief that *PROPNAME* is AWESOME.
is tired.
spent another sleepless night tossing and turning, only to get up at 9 am and deal with a kid who, I swear, has the loudest, most ear-piercing scream I have ever heard (and uses it). To top it all off, I got a call from the clinic saying that I'm anemic, and they want to put me on yet ANOTHER iron supplement that I can't afford. FTW.
going to the in-laws for dinner then home for the evening.
can finally be on the net at the same time as her husband.... hooray!

tried to shovel. It was a bad idea.

thinks both her and her husband have sleep apnea.
My net sucks big, hairy, red man-balls. ARGH!
I am the eggman, they are the eggman, I am the walrus! Coo Coo Cachu!

I may be the only *PROPNAME* in the world - I'm definitely the only one on Facebook.
Happy Father's Day to all you Dads
I have hardly given more information in the octameter,heptameter, hexameter, or pentameter than there is in the tetrameter- of course the boys are sleeping, you can't wake someone who isn't and a very roof is still a roof.  "The Ode Less Travelled." *PROPNAME*

Its true what they say; ignorance IS bliss. I envy kids that way, for not having the mental maturity to understand all the problems surrounding them. Its nice to see that happiness and naivety every once in a while.
is introspective...
CRISIS Next weekend my brother is having a giant sleepover with four of his devil spawn minions. 1) Isnt he a little *old* for that kinda thing? 2) Last time ONE of them came over, I had to listen to Three Days Grace on full blast on my iPod so I could concentrate enough to READ. Yes, you heard me! If anybody who a) isnt a pervert, and b) doesnt hate me could offer a place to stay, I would be grateful...

REALLY doesn't feel good and REALLY wishes her boss (who even acknowledged that I'm sick) would send her home.
excited about seeing The Used this friday! I bet nobody knew how hard I like to rock  :)
is temporarily upset with Obama for being in a commercial with *PROPNAME*.
had a really really good day
watch "The Age of Wal-Mart" on CNBC
No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day.
chips and salsa must be made with crack or heroin. What else can explain my addiction to it?
I know this is old news, but I don't think *PROPNAME* could be more annoying or less funny.
bored as hell...
loves myth busters. Now I can double dip all I want!
needs a drink...
I am wrecked, I am overblown...
how come every time I make a cake with whole wheat flour it ends up tasting like corn bread?  I like corn bread a lot, but I'm trying to make a cake that tastes like CAKE :(
is still in shock...
has done way too much driving and sat in way to much traffic this weekend
survived *PROPNAME*'s Scary Farm last night...for two... whole... hours...
goin on a cruise to Mexico!

doesn't feel so good :(
craves enlightenment...

is eating a huge bowl of piping hot homemade chicken soup... mmmm...
I have the worst sore throat and earache (now going on three weeks); and because health insurance is a luxury I no longer have, I am now in the process of trying every home remedy known to man.
the unemployed life is a strange one, I'll tell you that...
loves 3rd Rock from the Sun reruns
, after this weekend, kind of sort of maybe feels like she MIGHT want to move back to the IE...
wow... what a weekend
COME on Angels!
needs, wants, yearns.
hates it when she buys stuff at one grocery store, then goes to another store for something the original store didn't have, and finds that all the stuff she did buy at the first store costs less at the second store. Ugh.
is going to get off her ass and actually be productive today!
Comedy club tonight! Woot :)
Change your language to English (Pirate). Click on the English link on the bottom of your Home page. It's pretty awesome.
walked by a full IV bag (complete with hose) in the gutter outside my apartment...
is never drinking again
wishes her apartment had a heater :(
had an interview today. Crossing my fingers that I get a call (a good call) tomorrow!
and her friend really need a DD for tonight. Any takers???  :)
goin to the dmv... woohoo!
had a wonderful and wavy weekend on the big blue
where can I find current episodes of Top Chef online? (if they can be found online) I'm so behind :(
really wants to study at a library or coffee shop today, but nobody will want to sit or drink coffee next to a girl who's coughing up her lungs...
Happy Thanksgiving all!
loves the picturesque view from her bedroom window
what a gorgeous day it is
off to Paris in the morning!
needs something to do tonight...
really wishes she lived in England or France right about now
really wants to see Avatar...tomorrow...night... hint hint ;)
just got home from Riverside to find less than a block from my apartment: SIX cop cars, a HUGE congregation of police officers (some with guns drawn!), and a helicopter circling the area. I have no idea what's going on!
wants her stupid sore throat to go away already!
excited about volunteering tomorrow! and hopeful about my job interview
this cold ain't gonna keep me from line dancin my boots off tonight! YeeHaa!
"If we were never ill, we would not know what it was to be well. If we never knew hunger, we would take no pleasure in being full. If there were never any war, we would not appreciate peace. And if there were no winter, we could never see the spring."
is sick and wishes her mom was here to make her some tea and chicken soup...
, for the first time since she first arrived on facebook years ago, started to fill out the "personal information" section on her profile.
the times, they are a-changin...
money should never be the goal, only the byproduct.
is beyond pissed at *PROPNAME* right now...
is eating top ramen for the first time in a LONG time...
really wants to chop all her hair off... well, not all of it, just a lot of it...
is super excited to see *PROPNAME* today!!!
*PROPNAME* was AAAWWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEE!!!!!!! I would go see his show live over watching it on TV any day!
is boycotting NBC
the night wasn't a waste afterall :)
going Salsa dancing tonight... hope I don't embarrass myself  :)
doesn't like thunder :(
sometimes wonders (as much as I LOVE *PROPNAME*) if the whole NBC vs. *PROPNAME* fiasco is actually a ploy to boost ratings and get better guests for the tonight show... because, if so, it's working...
just got home after not having been since 4:30 to find a candle still lit on my dresser... oops...
The God I believe in is with those who suffer, doesnt punish those or create evil for those who are already suffering
started the day off right: with a big fat ticket from the #%$&*!@ Los Angeles police department...
finally watched the final episode of The Tonight Show with *PROPNAME*. It was amazing, and *PROPNAME*'s speech brought me to tears. I also loved hearing that he and I have something in common; cynicism is my least favorite quality, too Ill miss you *PROPNAME*!
It's a concept that represents a profound shift from how we think about money and satisfaction and the obligation of a government to its people.
finished her taxes  :D
needs to go to sleep now! going rock climbing in the morning (eek!)
desperately needs a job...
take a nap or go to the gym... what to do what to do...
two fire trucks just pulled up to the apartment building across the street. I'm assuming//hoping it's not an extremely urgent matter because the firemen weren't exactly running into the building, more like moseying...
had a wonderful night! hung out with some really great people and listened to some really great music!
"If it's true, if I am indeed addicted to sadness, I absolve myself of blame. Responsibility rests firmly with my brain. It is a flawed design. Worse than the 1975 Ford Pinto and just as dangerous."
wishes she was a football fan...
from urbandictionary: "She has the most beautiful eyes and hair.  She smells that of a fall evening, and her voice will typically seranade you." and "A really sexy, funny, smart girl that every guy wants. 'Damn, you lucky bastard, your gf is a total *PROPNAME*!'"  :D
might need to start figuring out what organs she can sell on the black market...
anyone know if and where the state of the union address might be viewable online? I've googled it but can't find anything, and I don't have tv so I didn't get to watch it live :(
new goal for 2010: write something for publication and actually have it published.
Yay blue skies!
just interviewed at an organization whose office is in the same building and on the same floor as the Production, Art, and Writing offices for Mad Men. Pretty cool :)
"...the event marked a major shift, what I might call a 'paradigm shift' if I were the kind of person who used terms like 'paradigm shift'..."
is glad hulu has the entire Strangers with Candy series... funny stuff
going to an underground art show tonight complete with art (of course), live music, drinks, body painting, and free pancakes :D  It's going to be quite an eclectic experience!
will break that trap = =+ and climb out alive.

(self-with-other knowledge) -- "... the self is in fact entagled at both the interpersonal level with specific others in one's life and at the collective level in relation to the social groups with which one identifies. At a cognitive level, this implies that linkages exist in memory between significant-other representations and the self, as well as between knowledge designating social categories and the self."
[ ?? ] ??MBA???????!?! ????! ???? [notice] anyone knows what questions are on a MBA interview? please let me know!
two interviews to go
so... doubling the rate of failure ~ hahahah
In the rainning storm of the morning, by the path of a farming country, the silver hair woman said to me as I greets her, "When tough time comes, the tough kept going."
anotha day, anotha dolla

Just trying to play 1 round of golf before this summer is over!!

wicked salacity leads to anger and frustration
you're not sure that you love me, but you're not sure enough to let me go

another lonely night with nothing to hold on to but memories of better days...
exhausted
recovery day

Don't worry about the people in your past, there's a reason they didn't make it to your future.
she said, "you probably don't remember me," I said, "only every other memory."
she put him out, like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
This is the man cave, there's no women allowed in here. I got a jerk-off station for God's sake.
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night!
we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way

(801): You dropped me off at the wrong girl's house. (1-801): There's no such thing as a "wrong girl" make it happen. (801): alright see you in the morning.
CMU football...is there anything better?

False alarm...still invincible

Turkey Bowl at Beaver Stadium...sick!
i guess if that's what you're into...
Tailgating in the Wendy's parking lot is the new thing to do!!
LMFAO!
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own.  Everybody has their private world where they can be alone. Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you...
tryin' to keep the streak alive
To feel your pain, you feel mine. Go inside eachother's minds, just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through eachother's eyes.

34,865 Kleenex and some codeine later, Kea rejoins the world of the living...
took the first step toward developing a green thumb today. Windowbox basil, anyone?
Good god, vacation can't get here soon enough. Here I come sun, sand, fresh seafood, and pleasure reading!
Well, it finally happened: I bought a coffee so big it didn't fit in my microwave for re-heating. (Sub-status update: Go to bing.com for some major Boston pride ;-)
Enjoying the lovely golden weekend!
couldn't hate these new Gap commercials more. They are seriously the devil's handiwork.
s dream of a roof garden will not be dashed, gosh darn it!
is pretty inspired by how active (and cool) some of her geriatrics patients are...
So like, what's the deal with *PROPNAME*? I think I'm missing a basic understanding of this cultural phenomenon.
Did anyone else think it was obvious *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* were getting a divorce like 34 seasons ago?
Life is so good! Medicine rocks and I am so proud of my man for his stellar performance review today. Here comes the first Latino Microsoft CEO, watch and wait.
The roof garden is born! Will post pics after a dinner made with our very own herbs =)
hates saying bye to *PROPNAME*=(
Apparently, all it takes for me to go on a semi-psychotic, cockroach-killing rampage is two glasses of wine and a strategically placed Dansko.
Ok, the new *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME* is kind of amazing. NOW who is coming with me on 10//22?
Very slowly meandering my way toward garden bliss. Does anyone in Philly have a patio umbrella they're trying to rid themselves of, by chance?
Days becoming so much shorter...
Hooked on Weeds without any way of getting my next dose soon. Damn you, Netflix instant queue and your empty promises.
If this societal obsession with vampires had happened while I was going through my "phase" in middle school, it really could have changed my life.
Good luck on shelves tomorrow, friends!
Out into the cool fall air for lots of mocha and a little studying.
never appreciated how good a dancer *PROPNAME* was until the recent marathons of Dirty Dancing. Kudos where kudos are due.
Anyone interested in joining me for *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME* on Oct. 22 at the Electric Factory? Ticket are $35 =( but I'd go with good company!
s mind was just completely blown by the awesomeness of Zahav (Israeli restaurant here). Easily in the top three restaurants I've eaten at, worldwide. Go there. Now.
Enjoying the nostalgia of fall...
Hi, fall.
How about getting to bed early? Anyone want to jump on the bandwagon?
Forty-five minutes on a Rittenhouse bench, with a bag full of veggies and La Colombe mocha, really turns the day around =)
just had chicken McNuggets for dinner. This is a new low. And it's called "short call at CHOP."
Just burned out.
Q3 overnight call at CHOP tomorrow. Poopie.
forgot how much she missed House until she saw the premiere. Love it.
thinks it feels pretty fly to see her tiny shoots of arugula (and spinach, kale, and two types of lettuces) battling the odds!
Hm. Apparently running for the first time in months makes me simultaneously feel like horse $#!@ and want to devour a steak. Wasn't prepared for that.
How did fall completely slip through the crack between summer and winter?
Maybe I should have Bing'd whether staph aureus toxin is inactivated via boiling BEFORE boiling and eating the soup I left out for 24 hours.
*PROPNAME* at RitFit is my new favorite person. It's kinda nice to be cajoled into thinking you're "way stronger than you think" at doing bicep curls. And that's what I'm paying him for.
Just scared myself senseless by watching most of Dracula. I am such a bigger pansy than I used to be, back in my vampire-obsessed, middle-school days...
Sick day today =(
Weekends go by so quickly... =(
No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder*
had about 7L of insensible losses via mouth-breathing last night and woke up with a tongue the consistency of beef jerky. This viral URI can stick it up its tiny viral you-know-whoosy.
Holy crap. I am in love with you *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME*. IN LOVE WITH YOU.
Turned the heat on, finally.
can't taste her food and is officially pissed at her URI.
Somtimes you just gotta laugh.
finally drove out the dust ponies. They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat.
needs free and lazy costume ideas. The polls are open!
has 10 times more respect for *PROPNAME* after her crazy bra lady moves. Herioc indeed.
watched in shock today as a nurse on the bus poked and yelled at an old, disabled man for sitting too close to her in the section designated for old and disabled people. Wishing I'd said something.
Buy a Christmas//Hannukah//Kwanzaa//Solstice tree? Check. Get Step 1 books? Check. Start dinner before 10pm? Check. It's really amazing what we can accomplish when we're let out of surgery early!
Sunday blues.
I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face. Apparently the narrative was much more exciting and dramatic in my head...
Note to self: Trying to rekindle an old flame for string cheese is not well accomplished using low-salt, skim mozarella sticks.
Not only is Dracula good, but Batman Forever is still amazing. I had SUCH good taste in movies as a high schooler, holy crap! And now I like The Holiday?!
Christmas tree decorating. *PROPNAME* of the Bells. Potentially cocoa and//or holiday cookie baking. I am officially the worst Jew ever.
Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it...
Halfway done with med school and off to the Outer Banks for two weeks. Limited access to phone and e-mail, but will check when I can! CONGRATS classmates!
*PROPNAME* has officially caused my imminent failing of OB//GYN. I have spent a cumulative day reading "The Hunger Games" and its sequel, "Catching Fire" in the last week. And now I can't study because I'm pining for the final book in the series, which won't come out til August. Damn you, *PROPNAME*, and your cruel attempt to get me reading again!
Brokeback is officially the most depressing movie of all time.
Thank you, Case Files. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to expect when undergoing "The Menopause."
Home sweet turkey!
Sunday. *PROPNAME* gone. And the person standing in line behind me at the minimart, who saw me paying with a bill that had a giant inappropriate anatomical figure on it, was a pastor. Of course.
Me: "Omg I am tired after two robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies with bilateral salpingoopherectomies. *PROPNAME*: "Awesome I did a fatakanicous dilopidous internal rectomy today too." I pity the fool who is forced to date a med student.
T-6 days til St. John and leaving *PROPNAME* til March. I just realized how weird this feels.
Mmm. Nothing like tea and Galetti to transport me back to early morning breakfasts in Florence.
"Cuz when the roof caved in and the truth came out I just didn't know what to doooo, But when I become a star we'll be living so large I'll do anything for youuuu...". On repeat. I don't care if this makes me a loser.
got a white Christmas of her own: hilltop house engulfed in a cloud all day! Thx for pulling through, St. John ;-)
Santa must LOVE me; St. John bound in T-11 days!
If there had been a real fire tonight, everyone in my building (including me) would be burned to a crisp right now because apparently a fire alarm isn't enough to lure us from our dens.
wishes the weekend would never end =)
Waiting for a batch of homemade peppermint bark to set in the fridge to help ring in the New Year! Suck it, Williams Sonoma, with your exorbitant prices!
wouldn't mind if a Philly, NYC, or Boston friend posted pics of the snowy city to FB! C'mon, give a girl a white Christmas =)
Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT. (Just another morning's playful banter between someone studying for Step 1 and someone fighting off an awful cold...)
Finally caved and saw Avatar. As I suspected, real life now looks bland and 2-D. =//
just canceled out the vote of an obnoxious, be-cashmere-scarved prettyman chanting "*PROPNAME*, hare krishna, *PROPNAME*" in the middle of Starbucks. Health care for all!
Here's hoping the House and Senate can reach some sort of agreement...
Almost just passed out in the library trying to test my Valsalva//baroreceptor//HR reflex. And no, my reflex is NOT intact, thankyouforasking. Frick!
is officially more than halfway done studying for Step 1. Yikos.
just completed her night cheese ;-)
would rather be potting. Even after 10 hours in the studio this weekend...
s library nemesis has answered her pine nut brittle with chips, a paper lunch bag, and a thinly-veiled apology for his "snack attack." Touché, library nemesis, touché.
just found a blue rubber band in her pork wonton.
Really, USMLE World? You really want me to know which growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and which ones need JAK//STAT for signal transduction? I poop on you.
I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms.
1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad
Meh.
Ok, *PROPNAME*. You only get to name ONE disease with a name that ridiculous. Come on!
can't decide if it's good or bad that med students score worse than a monkey randomly choosing an answer for some of these USMLE questions...
just typed "loves 30 Rock so much it hurts sometimes" into the FB search box. I think I'm hemorrhaging brain cells at this point.
Had a dream last night that I defied the laws of the space-time continuum. Isn't that like the holy grail of dreams?
Who dat?!
Seriously going insane. Actually wishing I could move up my date to spare myself the psychological nightmare of last-minute USMLE studying.
thinks one of her library nemeses is trying her own emergency tactic on her, namely, faking a horrendous cough to drive others away. Oh, it's ON, bitch!
caved.

The key to realizing a dream is to focus not on success but significance - and then even the small steps and little victories along your path will take on greater meaning.

If I wear makeup, I'm fake. If I like to get dressed up, I'm a Tart. If I say what i think, I'm a bitch. If I cry sometimes, I'm a drama queen. If I have guy friends, I'm a slut. If I stand up for myself, I'm mouthy. Seems like you can't do anything now a days without being labeled.. So what, go ahead and label me, see if i give a shit. Repost this if your proud of who you are! x x

mad river & uncle Fatty's tnite, Rockit tmrw, Spain next week!!!! :D
The world seems a lot different without one of your closest friends... unbelievable!  He was awesome.
is up and down in the WSOP cash games... and he just finished reading Brave New World by *PROPNAME* & Death by Black Hole by *PROPNAME*.  Both books were good.
is playing the main event today, day 1B
Out of the Main Event... my 11k didn't make it far into Day 2.  I've been playing cash games non-stop for the last two days though.  Probably going to play again today... Now that I'm out, planning to come to *PROPNAME*'s wedding
read *PROPNAME*'s "Check Raising the Devil" in one sitting and enjoyed it.  An honest look into his life, and glimpse into the sometimes fun and sometimes dark side of vegas & gambling.  Also watching "The Universe" DVD set still... it's amazing.  If you lik
has left the country.  Enough poker at the WSOP, time to travel around a bit!
is back in vegas, ready to win the main event! ... not really b//c i'm never going to win a tournament.  hopefully I can take down a few $$$ anyways =)
has started doing Hot Yoga, and really enjoys it.  I think I'll make it a habit!
back from vid's wedding.. it was a blast!  Congratulations to them both.  I am ready for some more high stakes gambling in Las Vegas.  One time!
is leaving Manila in a few hours for Nice, France...
is a little sick of poker... been playing Fallout 3 a lot last few days instead of poker all day... =)
is chillin in Boracay at the Shangri-La.  This place is beautiful!  I just got out of farm country in the Philippines, and got massacred by mosquitoes.  Need a few days of sun and relaxation to recover.  =)
is playing the FTOPS main event in his hotel in Nice... trying to stay patient tho i'm tired from a day of travelling and just want to sleep.  Tomorrow I go for a week on a yacht... more R&R + fun people + a whole lotta gambling... sounds like a slice of heaven.
is posting this from 30,000 feet above the surface of the earth, somewhere over nebraska in an airplane.  Wow, what an amazing world we live in!
wow... so many cool stories... boats r fun I'm now in Cannes for the tournament coming up in a couple days.  ... getting a little homesick, been gone almost 2 months
did full-fledged bikram for the first time (a 90-minute class as opposed to the 60 minute classes i had already done)... and it was hard!  Damn, I feel great now though =)
is thinking maybe he needs to go visit peeps at some point in Cali now that he's single and has no excuse not to.  Holla San Francisco & San Diego =)   ... Just gonna add that to my ToDo List here... get around to that at some point... (wow im hopeless)
has a big bet on the WSOP final table... I bet on *PROPNAME* to win vs *PROPNAME* to win against *PROPNAME*.  Any other winners is a tie. I figure *PROPNAME* is about 3:1 & *PROPNAME* is about 7.5:1 I loooove my bet right now (no odds!)  I wanted to book more action last night vs *PROPNAME* when I saw him at the Bellagio, but he doesn't like his side anymore.  Ship the EV kidd!!!!!
feels like doing things is hard.
wow - i just played COD4MW2 all night with 3 buddies... I felt like I was back in college
thanks to my mom for an amazing feast... I just crashed out afterwards and caught up on 15 hours of sleep.  Now I'm up early in Poway and ready to go!  Who's out there???
15k at bellagio today... off to the races
just went paintballing in SD... always a great time!  The bruises go away after a few days, but the memories of capping your friends last a lifetime.
Thanks to the beauty of anythingyouwantdelivery.com ... I have CallOfDuty4MW2 on the way right to my place right now, for just a small delivery charge (along with some Chipotle)... I've been hearing amazing things about it (best fps since Counterstrike)... and I might have to do a little gaming
what a night last night... my liver took one for the team
is on a mission in the gym.  My body is changing daily, and I feel and think better then I have in a while.  Exercise: the only healthy drug!
is currently reading Fooled by Randomness... Today I put my book down in the midst of a reverie at my airplane window and felt as if my brain were a  bad sieve, realizing that I was bound to forget most of the wonderful things I was reading... If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten.
does not know anything about the destruction of any RVs outside of Las Vegas in the desert.
current favorite song: Chainside - I Would Die For You (Club Mix)
back in San Diego for xmas
is a relatively short stack going in to day 3 of the Bellagio 15k tourney... about to leave to go play now.
finished Fooled by Randomness... it's an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone.  I'm now 80 pages into Chaos by *PROPNAME* and am enjoying it.  Go reading!
thinks Backgammon is fun!!
is up a little too early in the morning (9:30AM)... and doesn't know what to do with himself.  I think I'm going to get some quality reading time with Chaos (*PROPNAME*)... btw there is a scale for the quality of your reading (how focused//distracted//tired, etc...), and right now i think my reading will be pretty solid
is stoked bc a big grocery store, a nice gym, and a pinkberry (best after workout carbs ever..) are all within 1 block of my penthouse in Ipanema.  Not to mention the beach is a few blocks away.  I am about to go to all those places and then the beach... I'm in heaven
What a beautiful life... my family, my friends... amazing. If I could have one "genie in the bottle" wish, not including any kind of life extension, I think I would take perfect knowledge.  i.e., complete knowledge of everything already known and possibly knowable to the human mind (excluding future events)
taking care of last minute business... because tomorrow I'm going to Brazil =)
missed my connecting flight from atlanta to rio last night, i now have to spend 24 hours in atlanta to catch the same flight later today.  it's under freezing here, and i have no long-sleeve tops and a single pair of jeans.  Hello hotel room!  Time for movies!  I think I might be coming down with a cold too... wow, I hope it's a quick one that just goes away.
is finally in Brazil after 2 whole days of travelling
just rolled out of bed, not sure what the plan for the day is yet.  but who really cares?  i'm just happy to be going along for the ride
wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched "House of Sand & Fog", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions.
back in Vegas... time to make Victory Poker a reality
I think I just spent about 45 hours in the last week playing a video game.  Mass Effect 2 was awesome, but I am glad to have my life back.  Still hitting the gym hard.
wow, I got d-r-u-n-k last night... hangover in full effect.  mike gets in today, and I think we are all going to the lake.  I might actually get a little sun... don't worry I'll have sunscreen =)
wow... mass effect 2 just arrived.  //life

I have to run, run to the moment that set me free. I need to know why I hear the sound... the sound of my dream -
Nothing comes to my mind...
Realised that he is actually a Virgo... lol
There is no emotion; there is peace.  There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.  There is no passion; there is serenity.  There is no death; there is the Force.

He who has not found something which he would die for has no right to live.
After 3 hours of online reading and research, I have diagnosed myself to have a type of Red-Green colour deficiency, under Anomalous Trichomy, called Deuteranomaly.  LIFE SUCKS! ...
So many words and faces... So many different voices... Where do they lead...
I love chaos, for most are consumed by it, blind to its hidden beauty, allowing me excludibility to revel at its magnificence.
I officially have got nothing to do ... at all... like... seriously...
Weak hearts faint, When troubles rises. Brave hearts soars, Steals all the prizes. False heart, it shrinks small in peace. And finds in fear, no sucrease.
It has been confirmed... I'm going to poly! >=D Now... to find a job while I wait... >.>
The americans have forgotten that they were once terrorists to the british ~
Can't believe he overslept today... of all days... ~.~ The Day of Reckoning is at hand! XD
never thought that he would see the day where he would wish for failure.
The world is so desperate nowadays that the promise for peace can win a man a Nobel Prize. Let's hope that he keeps his word.
I need to get a shirt that says, "I don't speak Chinese!" ... Like... seriously... ._.
needz moar!
Trust should only be given to those who truly understand its value.
Let's see... we've had typhoons in pacific asia, and now heavy flooding in the UK, bushfires in Australia, Landslides in Turkey, Volcano Eruption in Colombia, New mutation of H1N1 that's resistant to tamiflu, and a whole lot of violent human related killings, while here in Singapore we complain about water reaching our ankles... WTF?!
When you start debating to yourself on the mechanisms of magic, you also subconciously debate as to the strength of your hold on reality. Conclusion: Fantasy is addictive. O,O
No sense makes nonsense, but nonsense makes sense. So what then is nonsense, in a world without sense? O.o
It's amazing how easily you can find aunties that speak both Malay & Chinese but not english...
Me, myself, and my computer. Deja vu
had a - has a fever. Got stuck in a jam at orchard road. After the jam, bus broke down. While waiting at a new bus stop, two busses drove by without stopping. Ended up taking four hours to get home. God is Evil.
is finally on a Role Playing World of Warcraft Server! All aboard the Fantasy train! >=D
No more TV mobile Next year... I am sad... D:
"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked. "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad." "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice. "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."
Women speak because they wish to speak, whereas a man speaks only when driven to speech by something outside himself -- like, for instance, when he can't find any clean socks...
Watched Inglorius Basterds on Blu-Ray followed by Avatar in 3D and is feeling soooo Epic. Dayum.

A break from the norm in the wake of this storm is the strange sound of silence as I wait to be born
Well, according to my parents, when I was like 6, everytime my sister tried to call me 'abang', I'd shout at her and say, "Brother!! Not abang!!" At least now I know why I never got anywhere with malay >.>
There was a staff meeting earlier today... When everyone was gathered, attention focused on the manager, I heard the Godfather soundtrack start to play over the speakers... just before the manager started speaking... Coincidence? I THINK NOT! >.>
I made an oopsie :>
There's this guy at my workplace who only speaks chinese. We communicate through hand signals and inferrence on my part. At first, I just thought that he was really friendly, brotherly love and all that. Then when the aunties saw him smiling at me, then told me in english, "He's Gay." Now I'm scared O_O

Quote of the day: "Sex is a weapon the girls use to defeat us!" - Random Primary school boys who were sitting behind me on a bus... lol
Is sooo screwed for his promos..... Good Bye JC Life... ~.~

Asleep with open eyes.
The love of my life: repeat 800s on a sunny day.
"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment." --Buddha
Driving to nowhere. Accompanied only by the pitter-patters of rain on my windshield.
"We Americans think you have to accomplish everything quickly. We're the country of thirty-minute lunches and two-minute football drill...[we need to] slow down and make building relationships as important as building projects."  --*PROPNAME*

38 miles last week, more this week, lifting despite the soar screeches on my muscles. My body hates me right now...
It might be time for one last great adventure, a minimum 13 hour plane ride away.
My cat squeaks when he stretches.
Feeling Hypnotized.
There's just something about those cold winter nights.
Born three times.
This year, and especially fall has definitely established a theme for itself. Seriously Higher Being, watching a dark comedy may be fun for you, but I can assure you that living it is an entirely opposite experience.
Goals for the next 11 months: (1) Rock the fuck out of the LSAT (2) Run under 3 in the marathon (3) Get into a baller law school (4) Buy a BMW Z4 (5) Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia anyone???
Just ran 18 miles....
My new philosophy: study and get ripped. Fuck everything and everyone else.
Marathon in a few days O_O.
Thanks for the support guys! We did it.
"Sit back and curiously observe the ride. You're not going to enjoy it, but it is going to take you somewhere." --Me under the inspiration of some lost muse.
Long long long day
Going running down a trail of bright oranges and yellows.
Pop Rocks are the shit.
Yay for adventures.
A little tanner, great times, and now very current on hip-hop.
Thanks for all the birthday love everyone!

just cut *PROPNAME* trying to give her a little trim... :(  I'm taking it worse than she is... poor baby...  Now *PROPNAME* and I are going to grab us a bite to eat, then I'm trapping him in my apartment cuz he's not allowed to leave tomorrow.
*PROPNAME*'s gone home and I will be studying the next two days for a scary property midterm on Thursday that will be worse than going to the dentist----then I have a dentist appointment right afterward.... Basically I'm doing something I don't usually do and that is sulking and feeling really sorry for myself.  BUT, home on Thursday after the exam//dentist appt.!!! :)
is a sleepy girl... curling up in the bed with miss gigi to read a book, chatting with my love, and then sleeping as long as I want to.  I love not having Friday classes.
will hot chocolate make me feel better?
had to go ahead and cook some chili after *PROPNAME* made it sound so good... Homework and crossing my fingers for McDonnell, Bolling, and Cuccinelli!
taking *PROPNAME* for a walk and then attempting to write this memo...
ahhh... this is beautiful *PROPNAME*... I have so many true, yet politically incorrect things to say, but will instead keep them to myself...
*PROPNAME* just broke her collar when I took her out... With Broad Street right outside I only had a minor panic attack.
today is one of those "I don't like law school..." days.  My solution= pretending that I'm not in law school for the rest of the day... tv time.
went to the doc.... it's not H1N1, just a bad case of hayfever... benedryl and rest for me...
"You Better stop wining, pining, Get your dreams in line and just  Shine, Design, Refine until They Come True. And youd better get to living" - *PROPNAME*
"To take from one because it is thought that his own industry and that of his father's has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association -- the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."~*PROPNAME*
can't breathe out of either one of my "noses" (as my sister used to call them)
well my first class was cancelled because the professor thinks her whole family has come down with H1N1, so I'm trying to be productive anyway....
class, back to the apt. to pack, pickin' up a few necessities at Bass Pro, Dentist, then home for the weekend!! :)
Also, Happy XXrd Birthday to my Mama!
Oh my gee willikers----I do not like writing memos...
So, just about everyone on my friend list is highly upset that it's Monday; but I know that once I get through this "9-6 in class + homework after that"  Monday, my week is nearly over... PLUS home on Thursday for fall break!!!!  It's going to be a great week, I can just feel it!
was astoundingly productive today... chipping away is a lot better method than sitting around trying to figure out how to tackle the whole mountain!
life is way too short and way too good to stress out or worry... :)
Memo is over--- going to get something done to my hair, then cleaning the apartment and going out with *PROPNAME* for a little early birthday celebration!
So as I was driving to school this morning, belting "My Baby Loves Me Just the Way that I Am" into my coffee mug... I realized for the 500th time this week just how much I love life...  Can't wait to go home tomorrow and spend lots of time this week with my *PROPNAME* and my family!
C-SPAN is unbelievable... The House is a zoo this morning....  Rep. Dingell is being a very unfair Kindergarten teacher over an unruly class...
Tuesday is here!! Home after my property class... Happy Birthday to my MeMe Myrtle (my grandma) who is 80 years old today!!! :)  She's the best and I'm so lucky she's my grandma!
cleaning the apartment...
*PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*'s wedding went great! I'm so happy for them!!!   Wish I had my sd card earlier so I could have taken more pics...  Now, in Richmond and back to the real world... missin' my darlin'...
ohh, cleaning then reading for school... all the while just thinking about how much I can't wait to go home on Thursday!  Lots of time with my one and only, hunting, and all the fun and good people that go along with both!  Can Not Wait.
had enough of this memo today, almost done! Reading a good book until sleep... Can't wait until home on Tuesday... It's going to be a great week!
Coffee, Christmas Cookies, Civil Procedure and Christmas movies... :)
Back in Richmond after a great Thanksgiving break... missing my darlin' already...  Can't wait to get through these next 3 weeks and have my first semester of law school behind me... :)
so good to be home!  Planning to get a few things accomplished today and then going to see my love after he gets off work!
back in Richmond, reading for classes tomorrow and getting ready for the week.. can't believe I only have 2 full weeks of classes left of the semester....
oh future interests.... you defeat me.  Professor Berryhill, I admit that you are God, please have mercy on my poor, ignorant, 1L soul...
is wondering why her attention span is so pitiful... must... pay... attention...
has had a great week with my darlin'.... :)  It's gone by way too fast... now, hunting with daddy till *PROPNAME* gets off at 5:00...
civ pro outlining and watching The Pelican Brief... and before you think "she shouldn't be watching a movie".... it's a movie about the law and a law student, it definitely qualifies as studying in my book.... :)
In the final 2 week stretch!!
snowing in Richmond...
So I really have a final tomorrow... I think that's finally starting to set in.
studying Torts----missing *PROPNAME*...
Property Midterm = Over,  Life = Good,  Me = Packing up, Dentists appt., Home.
*PROPNAME* and I have successfully added a new trick to our list... playing dead!  We're excited!  :)  And we can't wait to show it off to *PROPNAME* when he gets here! <3
fried taters for supper... :)
law school... you are not too much fun today... December 18th, please come soon...
*PROPNAME* and I went to Blockbuster to get a couple movies... we both said we'd been wanting to see Four Christmases, so we got it... turns out we watched it together last year. haha...  A tradition in the making?  Teriyaki Pork Sirloin and stir fry for dinner... love having him here <3
So *PROPNAME* just ate the end of my highlighter... I think that means she wants me to stop studying...
Went to eat some mexican food, now fixing some homemade hot cocoa and watching movies with *PROPNAME*... <3
So I decided that personally thanking everyone for the birthday wishes was probably blowing up too many people's news feeds... so thanks to everyone!  <3<3<3
R.I.P. Orange highlighter.... that makes the score: highlighters-0; *PROPNAME*-2
memo-writing...
ready for Thursday afternoon when I get to go home and see my darlin'!
Working on being more positive and proactive...
Come 12:30, I will be done with Property!  :)
I feel like I lose my best friend everytime *PROPNAME* leaves to go back home :(  Can't wait till Friday when I get to go home, too.
my goodness, how I hate civil procedure...
showing this memo who's boss... :)
So glad to be home :)
Whoa... way too sleepy, way too early... Cookies and hot chocolate time.... :)
One final exam is behind me, my wonderful parents surprised me and came up for the evening, and *PROPNAME* is coming up tomorrow....  :)  I'm a happy girl.  <3
Dear God, I know you've got a lot going on with Jesus' birthday coming up and all, but I need you to take this Civil Procedure exam for me in the morning.  I know you take all of my exams for me, but I really need ya in an extra special sort of way for this one. Oh and  one more thing, please hold off the snow until I can make it home....
okay so why am I here going through a long day of classes and feeling stressed and overwhelmed instead of at home happily hunting with my love???  Oh yea, I want to finish law school and be a lawyer... I want to finish law school and be a lawyer... Just have to keep telling myself that.  haha.
Taking Miss *PROPNAME* to get groomed, then studying for my last exam on Friday... Can't wait for Friday at 12:30!!!!  :)
work 10-7, then to see my *PROPNAME*.
One more class, then meeting up with mama to go wedding dress shopping :), then home for the weedend!
Another week almost over?  My, how they seem to fly! :) Can't wait for next week when *PROPNAME* is here and we can celebrate his birthday!
I don't know what's worse... Constitutional Law or having it at 8:40?
hates that *PROPNAME* is leaving today, but had a great weekend and am excited he will be right back on Thursday!!! :)
Well... my elaborate surprise plan to take *PROPNAME* to see *PROPNAME* for his birthday has been canceled due to the weather.... but I'm still looking forward to the snowy weekend and we're just going to have to wait until April to see *PROPNAME*.  :)
congrats to *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*.  *PROPNAME* has a new little baby niece, *PROPNAME*!!  (She'll be mine, too, shortly!!)
I got the prettiest wedding dress in the whole wide world!  Was browsing through the racks and turns out the first dress I came to that caught my attention was the one I had picked out online and been looking at ever since last June!  Tried a bunch on, but ended up with that one.  :)  How exciting!
Summer job interview tomorrow... :)  Hoping it'll be my first and last!!
not at all enjoying *PROPNAME* being on 2nd shift when I'm home for the weekend :(
abandoning the library which could almost be confused with an ice box and going to grab some lunch with jessica... :) then back for a couple more classes...
trying out the new reading glasses, not sure how I feel about them...
wishing my fiance a Happy, Happy Birthday!!  I love you darlin' and hope you have a wonderful day!
Got a paid (as opposed to the increasingly popular unpaid) J-O-B in a law firm!  Starting next Friday, I'll work Fridays until school is out, then full time for the summer!  That and having a snow day all rolled into one makes today a great day...  :)
yay for an official snow day!! :) But still have that job interview as far as I know, so don't get to stay in the bed and watch tv all day.... :(
oh thank goodness I have Monday night tv to look forward to :)  Gotta love <3 abc family :)
R.I.P *PROPNAME*! You and your music will alway be in my heart :(
I  walked around whole Sundsvall today and half the way it started to rain.....
I'm off to work!! have the evening shift....

Motivation = Zero
Conflictmanagement are really interesting... I just find out that i'm more like my mother then I thought :)
Was on my first voice lesson today... feels good to start singing again... It was a long time ago... but now I'm back on track again ;)
I like my life right now... :)
Sometimes I realise how insignificant I am in the universe. Then I get over it.
Just uploaded photos. Wow, that ball was fun...
For some reason I have stayed up till 4am. I'm only a little tired, and I've run out of books to read. I've also started and finished a game I downloaded. Is there something wrong with me?
It's getting a mite windy out there...
I haven't gone to bed yet, but i'm heading that way...
Turning 17 on Wednesday, getting cake in tutor time on Thursday, nirthday party Saturday instead of work... what could be a better week?
Practically 17. =D So excited about Saturday, but not so excited about how much it will cost to hire a PS2 and Singstars.
I now semi-own a Playstation 2 slim! I also have Singstar mics and a memory card, now I all I need are some suggestions for games a beginner can play..? I quite like Crash and Spyro...
I had my hair dyed and straightened on Thursday. Now I REALLY want hair straighteners, but I have to wait until I've paid for my restricted test. Also, having washed my hair, I realise that my hair has quite a bit of cur//wave to it. Who knew?

i need a job
is checking her facebook a little more than she used to...but facebook still bombards her with more information than she has time to fool with!  Taking things at a glance.
is sick as a dog & about to go home early...bluhhhh
is sick of the pain.
...
I will be fine.  I've gotten through everything that has ever been thrown at me--nothing can keep me down for long.
will probably be taking a hiatus from facebook again for a bit...you know where to reach me if you wish to do so!
has a tummyache (again, stupid tummy) but is otherwise alright!
isn't gonna fool with facebook applications, but does check facebook briefly every day now, for what it's worth...
...my heart hurts.
is somewhat on hiatus from facebook for a while...may check it occasionally...*shrug*
is very well-rested, lol.
is doin' alright. Something I've come to realize: you can't depend on anyone ALL the time...but ALMOST all the time is a damn good percentage!
is so glad I finally tried a chiropractor!  My back hasn't felt this good in ages!  I was very crackly, lol.
Is still pretty much on facebook hiatus...if you message me I'll probably answer though. Otherwise, most of you know where to find me!
is relaxing...
Feeling pretty good since the whole 'tweaking my outlook' kick I've been on...except for this sore throat//sniffles thing, geh. But I'll live...hey, drinking tea goes along with the zen thing anyway, lol.
is determined to be strong.
feels kinda better after going home early yesterday & resting...24-hour bug?  Whatever it was I'ma try to take it easy today too.
gonna stay late at work to get some extra stuff done, & then go home & veg out. I'm a geezer today, I guess...
I mean to go to bed early (to get over the Plague of Atlanta), and yet I end up staying up all night doing practically nothing.  Story of my life.  Hmph!
Bev quote of the hour: "Bah, the chaos gods can suck my intangible throbbing member."
Doing enough work to compensate for being in Atlanta Thursday & Friday...blehhhh.  (Still at work at frickin' midnight!)  But the trip, the company & the brief respite from LI will be soooo bloody appreciated.
Am engaged in battle with the Plague-beasts of Atlanta. *sneeze*  Vitamins make good ammo in such altercations!
Yay Mythbusters!  Ninjas, explosions, and science, oh my! :D *nerdnerdnerd*
This morning my dad said "it smells weird in your apartment."  Found the culprit--something in my dad's house upstairs sprung a leak...right through my bedroom ceiling, saturating my bedroom.  My mattress, lots of pillows, some expensive clothes and some beloved posters I was saving...are all ruined.  And the water's still leaking!  Grrahhhh...
Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face*
Ok...there are piles of "junk that isn't supposed to be on my desk" that keep getting bigger...while the things that are supposed to live on my desk are magically disappearing.  What fresh hell is this?!
The Mighty Boosh is completely mad but completely awesome. It has soothed my disgruntled sadness with its peculiar brand of British inanity...and interpretive dance. *nodnod*
Today's sky is as grey as my default mood setting.  Sometimes it's rather exhausting being so exquisitely angst-ridden...*rolls eyes, sighs*
Gah...sick of feeling like crap! Gods deliver me from resilient falltime ailments...*brandishes stick menacingly...then gets dizzy and passes out*
"I said he's a fairy I do suppose//flyin thru the air in pantyhose//he may be very sexy or even cute//but he looks like a sucka in a blue and red suit//I said you need a man who's got finesse//& his whole name across his chest//he may be able to fly all thru the night//but can he rock a party til the early light//he can't satisfy you with his little worm//but I can bust you out w my Super sperm!!" Rapper's Delight on Superman
Feelin' pretty lousy today...basically zombie-ing through work, and not in the fun way.  I feel like part of my brain is missing and has been replaced by canned air.  Bleah...Monday is definitely my least favorite day!
I know it's gonna be a 'pajama weekend' when I find myself doing my weekend grocery shopping at the 7-11 at 5:30 a.m...
Oy, Jiminator--this bring back any college memories, lol? "I got BLOOD on my hands and there's no remorse; I got BLOOD on my DICK cause I fucked a corpse..." When I hear it I think of you, haha! :D
Faring alright, I s'pose...just sore, and scouring the universe for used Toyotas & Hondas...  Need transportation, STAT!  Anyone with input on the car front, please comment!  Hope everyone's Halloween rocked...
"Got an animated corpse//at my beck & call//you will find my skin cells underneath his fingernails//Carpet fibers from my car//Covering his coat and clinging to his follicles//Everyday we meet//Plot fourteen//As he hops in the front in the seat next to me//He can't wait til I tell him what I need//Then he nods a rotting head and then I set him free"
WTF...did I like, get Mono or something in Atlanta (and how would I get Mono there? I don't make out with my relatives, ew!)?  I've felt consistently crappy and out of it ever since I came back.  Meh.  In other news, thanks to Lorna, I have "Unpack Your Adjectives" stuck in my head, lol...
Errghhh...insomnia suuuuucks! *whines, ears begin to bleed*
2 people today mentioned that my Wall is disabled from being posted on...I didn't even know! Lol, changed it...post at will I guess. *shrug!* In other news...YAY CARTOONS! "YEEES, we have no// bananas// todaaaaayyy!"
Gah, bus schedules are confusing! *scratches head, which then explodes*
Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space... *zoned the fuck out*
"Coming to work is like being raped by a paper factory."--me (to my dadboss) on working at a law office.
might have contracted the rockin' pneumonia...but I hope I don't get the boogie-woogie flu--it sounds repulsive!  By the way, I hate that song. (No, I'm not sick...I'm just a weirdo!)
Almost forgot it was Sunday night...yay for new Venture Bros. eps!  (My preciousssss...)  But DUDE, who saw the Metalocalypse season premiere?  When that "surprise thing" happened I literally screamed in joy (woke up my dad, lol)!  Maybe semi-expected but still, WOOT!
Spacemen 3 are pretty good...but in moderation--too many songs in a row and they'll put you to sleep! Zzzzz...
"Woo-hah! Woo-hah! Got you all in check!" LOL
Checking out a car in the morning...hope it checks out--I'm not enjoying this carless whatnottery!
God damn it...I need for my laptop to NOT freeze for 10 minutes before deciding to perhaps or perhaps not perform the command I've clicked...I need a car that isn't a fucking pretzel, or at least SOME form of viable transportation...I need ADD meds that don't leave me staring off into fucking space at work...GAHHH!  Very fucking frustrated!  Anyone with input re laptop or car, please comment...*sigh*
It's insane how much time one has to spend on the telephone with basically everyone in Christendom after a big car accident...blahhhh...deliver me from being on hold all day! *glares at phone*
Meh.  Humans are a fickle species.
About to go to bed so I can get up early to check out a car tomorrow morn...*crosses fingers* hope this one pans out; the longer I'm trapped, vehicleless, the more likely I am to go completely bloody mad!
It's a DK kind of day. *nod*
"*PROPNAME* could never have Superman's baby. Do you think her fallopian tubes could handle the sperm? I guarantee he blows a load like a shotgun right through her back...The only way he could bang regular chicks is with a kryptonite condom...but that would kill him!"
Unproductive day...home sick & made no money, and no progress carwise...but at least I got some rest, I guess. *sigh*
Went and got the last of my stuff out of my...car...(read: twisted metal heap with fuzzy seats) this morning.  It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though...
Well, going to bed with a smile on my face.  Nice change from the rest of the week! Haha...somehow my facebook got switched to German for awhile...it was ok, 'cause I could read most of the German--just rather random!  This box asked me "Was machts du gerade" for half the night...lol.  Actually I might switch it back to German and leave it for awhile--it amuses me! :P
Soooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.  Getting the fuck outta LI, seeing my superawesome folks, finally getting some proper southern food, and maybe even checking out Decatur nightlife & Williams Street...the word of the day is "YAAAYYYYY!"
"Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man."--Friedrich Nietzsche
Bah! Humbug! In other news, I really wanna see Ninja Assassin! In other news...eh, don't matter anyway, nevermind.
Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!!
Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again!
I just saw an...interesting...car commercial. According to said commercial, apparently "Twilight's *PROPNAME*" drives...a Volvo. A Volvo. A vampire...in a Volvo.* Wow...I didn't think that that character could get any lamer; I was wrong!  *No offense to Volvo owners, the cars are fine...but 'Mister (supposedly) SuperAwesome Vampire' driving one? LOL.
is now friends with I NEED A FUCKING CAR!!!
I gotta ask: why pirates OR ninjas?  Why not both?  Also, two interesting concepts I've recently discovered: Horror Cakes competition on Food Network tomorrow (one of them bleeds when you cut the cake! AWESOME!)...and a children's book series I saw in the bookstore recently, called Vampirates...I dig the name, and the concept...not sure about the execution though.  Still...intriguing!
Feeling quite content, in spite of all that 'ails' me. *quirks lips into a serene smile*
"Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man."--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again.
Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears.
Finally got a car! 1998 Nissan Altima GXE w// 98,700 miles on it in pretty good shape. Mechanics aside, glad I have a car w// a stereo again. Don't like that it's white, but I took what I could get! Might either mural-paint or shop-repaint it if it annoys me enough.  Also had a really great weekend (Thank you, guys. Xoxo!)--nice change from the last few! Glad as hell I'm not stranded anymore!!
is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment!
Happy Halloween all! Stuck @ home recuperating from totaling my fuckin car yestermorn-they're right, it DOES hurt more the day after-but "I'M NOT DEAD YET!!" Great time last night tho-celebrating LIVING. Thanx to all who made it possible & who made it awesome! Yay Dethklok show, Asylum, & some fucking wonderful humans, including my rockin' friends & lotsa cool folks I met last night. *hugs the world, retreats to bed*
I'm back from Atlanta, over 24 hours after I was s'posed to be...am worn the fuck out.  But had a great fuckin' time down there before the airtravel assraping!  So, yay to that! ;D
URGENT!!  Does anyone want to see SONIC YOUTH with DINOSAUR JR. TONIGHT at Terminal 5 in Manhattan (show starts 8 PM)??  Sean is sick and can't go so I have a FREE TICKET to the show, which is SOLD OUT otherwise.  If you're interested, drop me a text!! 631-714-9319.
Sweet respite... *snooze*
Waking from a really good dream into harsh reality is one of the great cruelties of life.  *groggy and disgruntled*
...and now back to my regularly scheduled severe dangerously-nihilistic depression. :D!!!1!1!!!1!!!!one!
Bored with cartoons & porn...time to sleep I guess. *blink, shrug, yawn*
It just occurred to me that two of my favorite songs are punk songs about gruesome abortions ("Bodies" by Sex Pistols and "Die of Shame" by Tilt)...man, I'm just not quite right, lol!
"Just another manic Monday"...nah, not really--if I was manic right now I'd probably be getting alot more done, lol!
Intelligence is a curse, life a senseless disease.  Gods grant me respite by death or lobotomy...
My, how the randomness abounds!...but I need some sleep.
Heh...:"God I wish that I could hide away//And find a wall to bang my brains//I'm living in a fantasy,//a nightmare dream...reality//People ride about all day//In metal boxes made away//I wish that they would drop the bomb//And kill these cunts//that don't belong! I hate people!//I hate the human race//I hate people!//I hate your ugly face//I hate people!//I hate your fucking mess//I hate people!//They hate me!"-Anti-Nowhere League
My foot is asleep...maybe it's trying to tell me I should be asleep, too...*conks*
Today's stream of consciousness: Hooray for comic books, poetry and nerds in general...forgot my phone at home today, blargh (couldn't reach me, that's why)...swamped at work...pretzels suck...missing NOLA (especially the Quarter) alot today for some reason..."the holidays" are annoying me already...Wikipedia is addictive...so is Facebook, gods help me...!
Holy shit, the sky is falling: my dad actually CHEERED ME UP out of a tough spot for once!  Maybe he's learning!  Or maybe it was a fluke...either way, I feel a lot better now!  :)  Dammit someone find me a good yoga studio now, lol!
Meh. Bleh. Feh!!
My body may be a medical nightmare, but at least it leaves me hangover-free for some reason, hah!  Glad to see everyone last night...thanks all for the *loves* and for those who were kind in the face of my drunken overhonesty, oy.
Never enough
needs a change. Anyone know any yoga studios in or close to the Smithtown//Kings Park area? Gotta find my zen again!
Sunday bloody Sunday...booooring...!
Just had a 20-minute conversation w// my dad about midget porn.  Sometimes he ain't half bad, lol...
It's amazing what you'll watch on TV when you stay up all night.
"Yes yes yes, effervescently meaningless..."
Getting another potential car checked out by my mechanic tomorrow...god I hope one of these fucking things works out soon! *blows up apartment*
What's black and green and red all over?  Me after the GWAR show, YEAH! XD  Time for the sleep of a lifetime now, though...damn.
Getting out of the house, yay!  Going with 'Anon' (lol) to eat curry and hang out with folks or someodd.  Man, anywhere's better than being stuck at my stupid apartment!
Sick of this nihilistic depression shit--fine, life may be meaningless, I may be right about all the other disturbingly bleak shit I've been thinking...but I'm not a self-killer so I'm stuck here--might as well pull it together and live this crazy life I've got anyway, eh?  Some change is in the works (just in time for the New Year, ironically).
Yes, I have no bananas...I have no bananas todayyyyy!
Going upstairs to beg my dad for some of the wonderful-smelling eggplant parm they just made! *crosses fingers* No food down here. :(
Me da is my hero right now...he found me some fucking NYQUIL!!  25 hours awake is waaaay more than enough (especially when I'm sick).  Going to go smoke with the ghost in the back of my head (heyy, random little-remembered song reference!).  GOODNIGHT FOLKS!!
Went to the latest Disney cartoon with my dad tonight...it was set in New Orleans and it was surprisingly pretty good. But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech. Trying everything I can to get rid of it quickly!
I gotta admit...Powerpuff Girls cracks me up! :P  Yeah, shush. In other news...FUCK I'm freezin' me arse off!
If I'm stuck in the house long enough, maybe I'll clean it!  That's looking on the bright side I guess...at least I'm in a better mood and a little less ill than yesterday, though maybe a little stir crazy--I found myself dancing to the Baskin *PROPNAME* 'ice cream and cake' commercial, lol!
Ugh...headache and some amount of nervousness.  Resurrection tomorrow night though, yay!  Night all...
Holy sinus headache, Batman! *left eyeball, unable to take the 'pressure,' explodes out of skull, shoots across room, lands in file drawer under "O" for "Owwww"*
Tis the season to cough up weird stuff...yecch.
Can't sleep--landmines in my mind.  Awake since 6 AM, ugh...
Happy thingy, people...
Ok...broken snow shovel, and the plow bastard we called is 2 hours late.  Don't mind too much that I'm missing work, but I DO mind that I have no food in the house and wanted to go BUY SOME FUCKING FOOD!  That plow motherfucker will be getting my SPACEBOOT up his PLOWTASTIC ASS!  As long as I don't pass out from starvation first, hmph.
Had bad dreams last night, some sobering thoughts on my mind...yet I'm still in a good mood today.  I don't get it, but I'm not complaining!
Sad & depressed as hell, but ROCKING the LIVING FUCK out...weird combination.
Supposedly Hauppauge means "land of sweet water."  Somehow I doubt the water's very "sweet" anymore, considering that Hauppauge is now an industrial district...
Dear Santa:  I know I'm a Grinch, but could you please bring me a computer repairman for Christmas?  I'll make you jambalaya...
"And life is thorny, and youth is vain; And to be wroth with ones we love doth work like madness in the brain."--Samuel Taylor Coleridge
My car no longer screeches like a banshee passing kidney stones...thanks, Mr. Mechanic!  In other news, my 'simple' cold is worsening by the hour and I'm feverish...and all of the home remedies and cold meds I try are for naught!  Bah!
Well that was entertaining...got some of my dad's eggplant parm, but was treated to watching him, COMPLETELY sloshed, watch the Wizard of Oz and caterwaul all the words with both *PROPNAME* AND the wicked witch. He says the Wizard is a prick, by the way.  And, "Look! Look, Bev, they dropped a fuckin' house on her!!"
Sorry I had to bail so early on Sanctuary last night, folks...sick & tired does not a fun Bev make--sittin' in the corner like ol' granny watchin' the kiddies play outside! *scrunches nose*
I'm so pleased today I might start glowing! XD ...Hopefully more in a pleasant way than a radioactive way.  A new year is directly impending, YAY!!  Ecstatic for a symbolic fresh start// season of change, let me tell you!
Momentarily considered waxing poetic about the new year (one 'holiday' that is actually somewhat important to me), but it's all been said before, I'm sure.  Instead, I'm just gonna go get loads of sleep so I can enjoy tomorrow night's festivities wholeheartedly!
Second half of last week quite sucked and was uneventful to boot...may this week be an improvement!  *kicks suckiness repeatedly with pointy!pointy!shoes*
Dammit dammit I can't SLEEP!  Awake all night then tried to fall asleep for 4 hours.  At least if I had hypothermia I'd fall unconscious...hmm.  But that would require going outside...or, more importantly, moving.  Fuck that noise!
Hoping this insane wind doesn't blow me away to Oz...those Munchkins might've gone feral by now. *shudder*
I lahk the cut o' yerr jib...*licks teeth creepily*
Well...if my interactions and happenings of last night were any indication, 2010 may well be a pretty good year...but we'll see!  Happy new year, love y'all! :D
is currently being a disgruntled employee...grrr. *brandishes fist ineffectually*
Eh, why the hell not:  THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. Lets see how honest my FB friends are. Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes ME. It can only be 1 word. No more than 1 word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. Wonder how many brave friends will do this.
Busybusybusy! :D Out & about is much better than in and bored!
2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...)
Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much.
My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb.
Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah!
*sneeze, cough, snort* Blech!  Trying that Airborne shit TONIGHT!  At least I'm getting the screechy car fixed today.  Now if I could only find gloves that match eachother...*wearing one black leather glove and one knit blue striped glove*
"Is it special when you're lonely// do you spend your whole life// in a studio apartment// with a cat for a wife// The seasons, when they call you// do you barricade the door// are you stubborn, stubborn, stubborn to the core?...Then the longest winter// is on her way// you called her without knowing it// but now it's too late..." Trying to keep the zen, but it's hard to hang onto sometimes on nights like these.
Cold weather can bite me, and so can Christmas.  *sticks out tongue*  I'm doin' reasonably alright today but ehhhhh...got a 'eadache from 'ell.
*sigh*
OI!!!
Feeling DAMN GOOD headwise lately: forceful self-change of outlook, meds seem to be finally working, & I'm startin to get shit done! 'Course, meds need tweaking--one of 'em (dunno which) is also tryin to make me a zombie--not the fun movie kind, either: I get sleepy around 4 or 5 PM now; too damn early even if I weren't a night owl! PSYCHED bout the forward progress, but this zombie thing's crampin' my nightlife, oy!
Sick as a dog and wishing my heat worked better. Hoping for as little snow as possible, under these circumstances!
hates crying, hates her health (or lack thereof), hates snow, and hates Christmas and its trappings of tomfoolery.  Today has become a day of hate. *angry pout*
*Rootin' around for 'retro' Bev pics*
Meow meow TIIIIIREDDDD meow meow. *pokes work with stick*
Hopin' I'll sleep tonight! Went from one extreme to the other--sleeping all the time to not sleeping at all. What an unpleasant adventure this is being!
Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise!
Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol). Furnace was fixed today, though, so no more CM troubles, I suppose!
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?  Narrowed it down that far, but...so hard to choose hehe!
Have good weekend, meine leibschen, yes yes!  I kiss you, muah!  (Me, hausfrau?!  Nein, NEIN!!!)
Ehh...bite me!
"Some of the shows on MTV are not my cup of tea...mainly because I don't like huge pieces of shit in my tea!"
doesn't get it--even when I get enough sleep, I run out of energy LONG before the day is over...what gives?!  This rampant exhaustion really puts a cramp on my life & times...and now I'm gonna go sleep some more.  Hmph!
*sigh*
I try to keep my health complaints to others to a minimum these days, but...well, let's just say FUCK.  Sometimes I feel like being such a survivor is goddamned overrated.
Sleepytime at last!  Bundled up in blankets like fuckin' Jesus inna manger.  Or medieval couples that weren't sposed to fuck yet, lol.  Fuck off, snow!
So very frustrated...& kinda sad. And so fucking sleepy...god DAMN these meds, I'm sleeping my life away.
MEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHURRRRRGHHHHHHHH.....
is ok now.
Why do I insist on eating popsicles in winter?  OM NOM NOM
The cleaner my apartment gets, the more of my hobbies I get back into (partially because I can find my stuff again, lol!)...YAYYY!  First one to return: gaming.  I might not get back to the rest of those erstwhile hobbies for awhile, though--I tend to get quiiite obsessive about my vidya games, hehe...
It liiiives!!!  (Meds adjusted--we'll see if I stay awake today! *blinkblink*)
*shrug* Eh.
is trying not to be grumpy.
Ok lady I love you buh-bye! *finally leaves house*
Off to prepare for a night of festivitation...2010 here we come, haharr!
Getting ready for ma belle *PROPNAME*'s birthday whatnottery...may I not fall asleep face-down in cake this evening!*crosses fingers*
Hangin' with *PROPNAME*...stay awake, stay awake! *pokes self with fork*
Dear car battery: Why are you dead again?  What am I going to do with you?? (No, really--what am I supposed to do with it?)  You make me sad. ://
Hmm...it's hard to play 'find the smell' in your apartment when it's so cold that sniffing the air hurts!  But why the fuck does my place smell like a lawnmower anyway?!
Frisky Dingo makes my chest hurt...with laughing! I need to get Season 2 STAT. Damn, I would PILLAGE for some bourbon chicken right now! Glad *PROPNAME* is finally back in town...good times man! :D
Taken off the troublesome med! Back to Bev as usual now I guess.
BRRR!  "Stiff Little Fingers" indeed!
doesn't know what to think.
Upon taking a brief hiatus from facebook--holy SHIT, too many updates to read! *mind boggles*
just remembered a TV ad from her childhood in the 'glorious' south: horribly fat, hideous ANGELS with big ol' hair, Tammy-Faye-esque makeup, and (of course) heavy southern accents hollering "DON'T YOU BUY NO UUG-LY TRUUCK!" Cracked me up then, cracks me up now, HAHA!
Meow?
Too lazy to scan 'retro' pics right now--fuck it, maybe later. I notice that I pretty much look the same as I have for the past ~15 years (kinda freaky!!)...thus, it's hard to tell what year a photo is from. Oddly enough, my skin was better when I was a teenager than it is now!
Black.
Well, meds situation is not ideal by any means (zombieish again) but it's a vast improvement on the last few days of horror!
I think I've finally found the right med...this must be what normal people feel like!
I feel pretty spiffy today--befuddling my dad with random comments, doin' my weird acrobatics and dances, singin' wordless nonsense songs...alot better than medicated zombie Bev (though admittedly alot more absurd, LOL)!  Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D
Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.)
has been too busy living life to spend much time on facebook this week--just the way I like it! :D
Whew.
Got to be 'early to rise' tomorrow, so I'ma try to be 'early to bed' tonight...thusly, going to bed now; we'll see how that goes!
is amused at the universe today. *cracks up*
Hm...started the day out feeling ok, but now I feel like three-week-old leftovers molding in the back of a broken fridge in Hell...yes, a Hell-fridge. Guess work doesn't agree with me!
Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.  My dad opened the window by the furnace and my living room window and went back to bed, nice.  Hmm...gonna go back to sleep if possible and hope halfheartedly that I'm still alive in the morning.
made it safely to italy :) 22 hour trip lol havent slept one sec the whole time will upload pics of my trip soon and through out the month.

108. Nearly in double digits.
157
*has to call the helpdesk for my mobi carrier* to do that I have to charge my phone and to do that I need to find an adaptor. *sigh* why is this holiday so complicated. If it's not one thing that's gone missing, it's another. Or not knowing something that
168. That's it.

Knows two things about travelling if nothing else. (1) Make sure to have atleast two account cards when you leave home. (2) Make sure to have booked everything before you need it so you don't end up getting stuck in one place longer than you wanted.  And I think I may know why my card didn't work yesterday... gonna try it out tomorrow if I can.

it will be hot for the next few days, but it looks like we should be getting a denser cloud of percipitation coming over san diego soon which should help cool things down a few degrees. but don't hold me to it i'm not an actually meterologist so my interpertation of the satalite imagery might be off a little.

is going to be full of himself for no real reason for the next couple of hours. He also made really good chocolate chip cookies, from scratch by hand.
just got a shot in his ass for his headache, that works like how he imagines works like Vicodin for House's leg. Minus the addictive part that is. Basicly *PROPNAME* is in a good mood now that he isn't in pain.
I have my car back!! *does happy dance* No one witnessed that.
is praying for a phone call from the doctors saying the neurologist accepted his referal and will see him soon.
was at UC yesterday and apologizes if he seemed a little out of it today. They gave him another pain shot.
just spent a half hour ductaping a tin can only to through it out. Then spent about an hour playing with ductape, and made pouch that he will never use. *PROPNAME* feels really cool right now. :)
"I just want you to know that I'm saying something brilliant. I'm just not explaining it very well."

MR. FROSTY, that is the grand finish of a good summer.
has decided that the laws of physics must not apply to his project. one side takes 21.59 seconds to drain water to the other side. The other side takes fron 58.9 seconds to 80.4 seconds to empty. The same results happen over and over with no explanation
"Just because I know everything doesn't mean I'll be telling you anything true."
s mind has decided to check out for a while. It left a note saying it should be back around 11 am tomorrow.
s head would explode if his skull wasn't being hammered on by numerious sledge hammers. needless to say my headache has decided over the counter painkillers only make it more angry.

I'm on call, to be there.
"Its only illegal if you get caught, assuming you're stupid enough to get caught in the first place"
feels the need to say something deep and profound, but its very late and he is tired from his workout today. With those conditions this is the best he's got.
does all his status updates in 3rd person. This will likely never change.
is exhausted, stressed, and is having an awarding winning bad luck streak in terms of things going his way. But for whatever reason was nominated for the homecoming courts.
is tired and probably sick but likes to stay positive and think its just allergies(pretty sure thats spelled wrong too). But had an amazing time at a murder mystery party being the main investigator, and was close to getting the right answer but didn't have enough information. He also intends to finish polishing an essay for english that is way longer than any essay really has the right to be.
just washed a paper plate so that he could use it for something else. It would have been easier to just grab a new one right next to him.
has probably, most likely, lost what ever symbolance of a mind he once held.
"she only drinks coffee at midnight. when the moment is not right, and her timing is quite, unusual."
made the most amazing burritos for dinner and feels sad that he can't finish them and enjoy their great deliciousness anylonger...
6k+car break down+friday the 13th=me feeling superstious. 6k=fail=me tired
is awsome. Period.
got his hair cut at 2 today. He just now hopes that he can replicate the hairstyle half as well as the stylist.
s brain feels tired. Stupid SAT making be sit in a room for 4 hours when it should only take 2 1//2
is tired and his pupils are still dominating each respective iris. Can anyone say super night vision?
just reliezed that devouring chinese food the night before a 6k test isn't the best choice of foods to have consumed if he wanted to do well on the test.
Saw the Mouse Trap! It was positively amazing!!! Great work to everyone!!
woke up from sleeping over 13 hours about a 1//2 hour ago.
s sister ate 5x's more than he did, she is 5"5 and 112lbs, in her first sitting than he did the entire meal.
watched Transformers II with *PROPNAME*, has a neuro appointment tomorrow and can't find the headache log. Made pretty good pastries, will have them perfected when the next batch is made.
Black friday shopping+ *PROPNAME*= fun Black friday +waking up = 3hours of sleep Yet somehow am oddly awake even if i've already had a full day before noon.

hid in the closet for the majority of the day
hung out at *PROPNAME*'s today, wrapping presents, then went to the park and played on the swing sets. Can anyone say awesome??
riverside is a strange and wonderious, mostly strange, place were when you show up at noon you are required to murder avocados and eat dinner at 3:30. Merry Christmas world, i'm stranded with my family.

i have Serenity in Blue-Ray. Its really really cool.
is making better than sex cake. it better be, it certainly costs enough.
Santa isn't bringing me presents this year. He sent Mal and River to do it, I don't think he considered the noise factor of Serenity though. (If any of you get the extreeeemly geeky reference I'm making, just smile and accept that every year i wish for Firefly to start up again)(Hint, Hint, Santa)
I harbor a strong distaste for 6ks
1 honest answer. you can ask me one question (send it to my inbox ) any question. NO matter how awkward it can be, I'll answer it honestly. There's no catch but I dare you to post this as your status and see what people ask you.

Thx everyone for sending the vpn tools. all blocked sites are accessible with superb connection =o)
Opening a bank account in China went really fast. You sign 6 documents and they immediately print out a card and pincode. The whole process took about 25minutes.. Moved into my apartment today as well. Good location, nice furniture, good view but an odd bathroom and a very minimalistic "hallway" .. =)
9Minutes
Had an exciting day in the office, big lunch with the new team etc. the Office Manager is a real sweetheart, bit of tomboy attitude, rough but cordial.. I think I will fall in love with her.
Bloody Monday is done in 53Minutes =))

Going ot Ko Chang Island to hopefully ride some elephants!
I was one of the lucky ones to get air conditioning and internet in my apt in Thailand! Yay!
Last day in Ko Chang : (  but teaching starts Monday : )
I've been wondering why no one can leave me wall post. . .figured it out! Yay!
Yeah, about that hot water....
12 days and counting... . oh and Surrogates sucked! Save your money unless your want to see a crappy version of I Robot.
After teaching for just 3 weeks, I finally understand the importance coffee plays in people's everyday lives.
Never seen a 10 year old and a 60 year old driving a motorcycle on the same steet until today :)
So I was watching the news in Thai and they showed a picture of the Earth and the Sun and a big comet like solar flare thing circling the Sun. .Umm is there something I should know? Do I need to find a bomb shelter? I am so out of the news loop, I found out the US health bill passed on Facebook for god sakes!
Tahtako is small and no one speaks English, but the people are friendly!
Lesson planning sucks. . .so I'm procrastinating.
Is not looking forward to this reeeeeally long flight!
3- Day weekend! Going to Chaing Mai! If anyone is going to be there, call us!
I was woke up at 7:30 in the morning on Sun by my mother informing me of the Gator loss. If I wasn't so hungover I probably would have cried. : ( I still love you Gators!
I'm wondering if I can make it through another 3 days of singing "head, shoulders, knees and toes" 10 times each day.

Could I be anymore bored?
Can't wait for February so I can start traveling again!
Its hilarious trying to explain Easter to the Thai children. Yeah . . so theres this rabbit that comes to your house and hides eggs. . yes eggs . .and then you eat chocolate thats shaped like rabbits and eggs . . and thats how we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ haha. They either have a really confused look on their face or just laugh.
An extremely attractive girl whos flirty personality and curvacious figure will keep you coming back for more. She's typically a brunette but occasionally acts blonde. She enjoys long relationships and has many close guy friends. Often mistaken for a "slut" but really isn't. She can also be a super bitch if you get onto her bad side. "dude, i want to hang out with that girl, shes such an *PROPNAME*" haha
Do I have a celebrity look-a-like?
A kid in my class put a frog down another kids shirt today, along with the branches the frog was in.  After the frog, leaves and branches fell out of his shirt, the boys spent 5 minutes trying to catch the frog, while I (the teacher) stood in the corner with the screaming girls afraid of the frog. Then the frog peed on the boy who caught it. Thank God it's a short school week!
had to laugh when the doctor was cutting off her Thai good luck bracelets in order to put on a cast.
Lame Canada! Sorry neighbors to the north, but after Chinas opening Olympic ceremony 2 years ago, that was just weak. Even *PROPNAME* cant show up 10,000 in sync drumming Chinamen. Glad the U.S. didnt get the bid for 2010 lol.
Thank you everybody! Love you all!

New Year's resolutions... why wait until January? Screw that, December is MY month! I will exercise daily. I will not fall asleep randomly without brushing teeth (eww). I will clean my room weekly. I will not save files with names like 'adsvdsq.' I will finish all tasks by 75% of the deadline. And for motivation, I will move $100 from my checking to my savings account each time I fail! Go go self-improvement!
Baking in my room. TT

You know in Spiderman where he wakes up, puts on his glasses and realizes he doesn't need them anymore? Yeah, I had that today then I realized I had my contacts on. -.-
I just had a dream that combined The Grudge + Twilight + Harry Potter + Pokemon. Malfoy had unsealed the Grudge demon from within Bella and Bulbasaur and Jigglypuff had to save the world. WTF? That doesn't even make sense.

Working at home, wathcing the *PROPNAME* game, and watching the snow.  The words "lazy Saturday" come to mind.
And yes, I misspelled "watching" not once, but twice.
Wow, that was a great game - even if *PROPNAME* did lose. Hope the 1 v. 2 game tonight is that good.
Really?  Two days in a row?  I would like to take back my comment about de ja vu - I didn't mean I wanted it to end like that (again).
absence sharpens love, presence stregthens it
It'a kinda like de ja vu - working at home, wathcing the *PROPNAME* (Steelers) game, and snow is still on the ground.  Good thing I know its Sunday!
Put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered the LOSS of a Baby ? The majority won't put it on because unlike cancer. Baby Loss is a taboo... Break the Silence ? This is in memory of all the Angel Babies...gone too soon but NEVER FORGOTTEN ABOUT!!? Show your support and let these women know they don't have to grieve alone.
If you & I woke up in jail together...using only FOUR words...what would you say to me? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say....(And if you make a comment, you gotta put this in your status. Fair is fair.)

mmm waffles n_n
avril stuck in my head from yesterdays singing performance. soooo sad
freezing my freakin ass off. don't want to get out of bed for anything today :(
*PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* are officially the two most awesome people ever :)
TOAST n_n *purrs*
marty liebich...... LOL
Breaking hearts is part of who you are.
i give up.
MAINSTREAM. ALL DAY LONG... KILL IT.
goddam it. this celebrity double thing is driving me crazy. help
Just remembered, I seen a naked guy running up the supports on the squinty bridge last night with all hanging out .. but wearing socks. Not a pretty sight.
Seen a leaflet guy coming into building. so i collected together all the leaflets we have (about 15-20) and when he went to post the leaflets I posted them all outwards as he opened the letterbox. He looked a little confused and tried to push them back, so I posted them back out again. Ahh its fun to piss off people.
Feeling like crap, no temperature though so at least its not swine flu (at least I think its not!)
Got a pair of degu's last night, already causing issues! They are uber cute though.
Got a refferal to a ENT specialist so I can get a camera jammed up my nose into my sinuses. Not pretty but at least I may be able to finally get rid of this damn sinus infection! :D
Trying to send docs to the bank, and my personal advisor is not trusted with email or web access full access to my account, financial and personal, but not email *worry*
Gotta love 3 mobile. I asked to cancel my contract and was asked "could we convince you to stay" I replied with "Due to the terrible customer service, I would rather die a slow and horribly painful death than stay" to which I got "do you have any friends or relatives you would like to refer so they can get a good deal". I want that CSR to work in my company retention department!!
I think I must be doing something wrong on the trapeze, it feels like I have just went for a vasectomy after trying a few windmills yesterday. No pain no gain :)
ARGHHH!!! The radio has christmas songs on it already, this bad bad bad news! Its november !!
I have 1.6Kg of explosives for Nov 5 (The UK equiv of 4th July for the Americans), Hopefully with any luck this thing will make the night time look like daytime with the bang :D
Trying to weigh a degu is not easy!
Never had a crab, squid, musccle, scallop, and anchovie pizza before. It is however suprisingly good :)
Whilst I may not understand the history behind thanksgiving, I can get behind any holiday that consists of a huge amount of food, alcohol and friends. Happy thanksgiving to my American friends. And to anyone else, today is just an excuse for us to take part in "cultural diversity" and get drunk and stuffed with lots of food.
is thinking that he needs to assemble a horde of flying panda colored monkies to wreck havock on the world from above, and buy milk.
I can handle the scope thing being shoved up my nose and down my throat, I can handle the CT scan, but having blood taken, still can't deal with that!
Why are you not allowed to give kids nuts for halloween any more. I got them as a kid, and as far as I am aware people havne't become more allergic to it in the last 20 years, just the same amount.
Hates facebook messaging, it always looks like you are waiting for the other person to message back, and then you see that it has infact timed out (again) and the person messaged back 6 hours ago. *sigh*
I have discovered the 'teddy bear' move in aerials, is anything but cute and fluffy! Its evil, sore and likes nothing more than cutting off all blood to your extrematies.
is currently working his way through the harry potter box set. Can't say I don't have exciting weekends!
I know 6 sick people at the moment, and now I'm sick. I'm going to find out what one it was and come after them!! Watch yourselves ;)
Happy Jul, In norway they don't celebrate chriastmas as much as Julaften (Pre-Christmas). Thats when people get their pressies. In russia its the 5th Jan!  Don't know if I could wait that long!
I love how much fun you can have with non newtonian fluids :D
The turkey is now officially drunk (Injected with enough alcohol that if we didn't eat it, it'd be at AA). Rubbed with secret spices, drizzled in bacon, and the silverside joint is slowly cooking for 7 hours. 15 Minute break then  back to cooking :D
My brother gave me a uni-cycle for xmas. I'm wondering if you can pre book appointments to the A&E to save time.
Just hacked my appleTV, removed the WiFi chip and replaced with a broadcom H.264 hardware decoder chip. Now I can stream blu ray movies in 1080p from my fileserver to tv :D
Just realised he missed the aerial class start :| Thought it was next week it started DOH!
thinks that the new apple tablet 'pc' iPad sounds like a high tech sanitary device.
Merry Christmas everyone :)
They are NOT beef sausages if they are only 40% beef! LIES!
Just made a spiced haddock on trimmed green bean and coconut rice with a coconut, chilli sauce... mmm
It's time I fire up this life I'm livin' in!
Cuando la vida misma te ha puesto en un aprieto, ¿qué es lo que se debe hacer?
Que es lo que en realidad se debe de hacer? Lo que el corazón dicta o lo que la razon te dice?
Es momento de aprender a dejar ir las cosas. Por favor, que aquella luz, guía mía, me lleve a los lugares indicados.
Oscilando entre la infinidad de la mente y la infinidad del sueño...
Hay veces en las que simplemente quisiera olvidarme de todo y refugiarme en la profundidad de mi mente...
Meus somnerium... En busca de un pequeño momento de comprensión...
De vuelta al mundo interno sin límites!
Por favor, que las cosas mejoren! Si es que en verdad alguien puede ayudar, que le otorguen lo que necesita!
Getting ready for the fun! Escapada espiritual al corazón del oráculo... Riviera Maya! Meus somnierum!
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart! I want to recognise your beauty is not just a mask! I want to exorcise the demons from your past! I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart! (Gracias a Sofi por la canción tan genial!)
I just... Don't know what to think anymore...
Life truly has special ways to show us what we need... in the weirdest moments////f i n a l f a n t a s y////"I know. I'm not alone... not anymore."
Back to the routine, then...
is trying to get out of the doldrums
is in Aruba!!!
-- people need to get over michael vick's life and get their own
vegas baby!!! yaaa!!!!
once again doesn't remember going to bed. And she's upset with how much drunk *PROPNAME* tries to screw around with hungover *PROPNAME*. This isn't funny drunk *PROPNAME*.
is glad that it's summertime, and the living is easy. One of these mornings, she'll rise up singing.
just got home from spending 11 glorious hours with her family. It was an awesome day. Sorry for all the missed calls and texts, my phone died many hours ago.
I'm leavin' on a cruise ship, but I do know when I'll be back again. Seriously though, no phone or internet all week, so I will be incommunicado. You kids have fun, try not to do anything too crazy.
is home again! The Caribbean was amazing!
had good talkings tonight. Fun times were had by all.
One more double before nine days of freedom.
can't stop here! This is bat country!
You win some, you lose some. Week 2 doesn't say anything about the Playoffs. There's always next week. And lets be fair, the competition next week is the Chiefs. Ahahaha.
ought to be cast in the next big zombie movie as an extra. Because she feels like the living dead must feel after a night of heavy brain-eating. Is that their equivalent of drinking? Explains why they want to do it all the time.
needs to be herself, she can't be no one else. She's feeling supersonic, give her gin and tonic. She could have it all, but how much does she want it?
Damn, those Eagles looked sharp today. Too bad the Red Sox couldn't do the same.
Made some cash last night playing poker. Hopefully a repeat performance tonight?
hasn't felt the way she feels today in so long it's hard for her to specify.
has got no time to for spreadin roots, the time has come to be gone. And though our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on.
is at a weird place in her life right now. A road map would be handy.
has the damn flu. Could the universe's timing have been any worse? She thinks not.
Woot, go Chiefs. :D
would love to have something that even remotely resembles a reasonable sleep schedule.
feels severely under-appreciated. It's lame.
has had a very good day, and looks to have a good night also.
doesn't look different, but she has changed. You're looking through her, she's not the same.
wants to live where soul meets body, and let the sun wrap its arms around her, and bathe her skin in water cool and cleansing, and feel, feel what it's like to be new.
has learned that standing in front of her open refridgerator and freezer doesn't make any of her food look any more appetizing, but it does start defrosting the food in her freezer.
proved her epic ninja skills tonight.
shall live in the sunshine, swim the sea, and drink the wild air's salubrity.
was hoping some of the punk kids in her apartment complex would nab the jack-o-lanterns off her balcony and give them the honor of a good smash. Instead she had to unceremoniously toss them in the dumpster.
will begin tomorrow well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with her old nonsense.
is gonna blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head.
had one of her worst nights ever at work, after spending all day actually believing today would be a good day.
will have a bit of fun, watching everyone pass her by.
is sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun.
(573): Fact: The drinking you do in college doesn't affect your liver in real life.
wanted more than life could ever grant. She's bored with the chore of saving face.
loves that she has some of the nerdiest friends ever. She's seen at least ten *PROPNAME* poems posted today. Granted, everyone picks the same one from V for Vendetta, but m'eh.
is feeling uninspired and unmotivated. Can someone else please pay her bills and move her into her new apartment?
is tired of being passed over.
has gotta tell you what a state she's in...
is having the worst day since yesterday.
learns more and more every day that timing is everything.
is still living with your ghost, lonely and dreaming of the west coast. She just wants to feel some sunshine.
just thought that you would know you're a god, and she is not.
took these broken wings and learned to fly. All her life, she was only waiting for this moment to arise.
doesn't want to be at the mercy of her emotions. She wants to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.
is watching the lights go down, letting the cables sleep. Whatever you say, it's all right, whatever you do it's all good.
is simultaneously packing, doing laundry, cleaning, and jamming out.  Ah, productivity.
is home from work and back to packing//cleaning. January 2nd can't come soon enough, because this is starting to get really monotonous.
can be painfully petty and selfish at times.
Doppelgänger week; change your profile picture to someone famous you have been told you look like. After you update your profile with your evil twin photo, then cut and paste this to your status.
wants the kind of things that money just can't buy.
hates to admit that she's becoming more and more of a morning person.
is very glad to see that it's legitimately storming outside. If only she didn't have to go back to work in just a few minutes...
is, by far, the biggest nerd she knows sometimes. Which really says a lot if you know her friends.
just realized she's been awake for 22 hours. That might explain the exhaustion.
had an amazing night last night, in spite of the fact that she was literally falling asleep on her feet.
Your grace is more than enough. Re-prioritization in progress.
stepped down from the last stage. But I won't say goodbye. Well done, *PROPNAME*:)
free style
loves his Ginosko ppl.
Losing trust on all those facebook quizzes. Just look on my wall. LOL

Merry CHRISTmas! Much blessings and love~~~

Walking away, with blessings behind.
The best day is ALWAYS today!

We could be sitting in the computer lab, 4 am before the final paper is due... OH CRAP!!!
Hold thy piece, thou knave...
is confused.
is writing a paper that is due tomorrow... What? I should be writing it instead of writing this status? If you say so...
Oh the irony... I am a dork.
only 14 chapters left to read...
Blue!!!
Hang on a minute, i have to put my phone in my cheese so i can get out my keys to open this door...
Look at spot. Spin. Attempt to find spot. WHERE IS SPOT? Oh. Behind me. That was not 360 degrees. Darn.
Is done with her paper! now to the next one...
Superbowl Monday!!! We should make it an official holiday.
So much for no accumulation... :-)

I have never changed my facebook pic ever, that should be a record right?
is sleepy and doesn't want to pack

Is trying to get her hearing back after nibbler decided to imitate her sneezing...very loudly.

"This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time."
is off camping
can't figure out how to get her hair cut. Any suggestions?
"The world is my ashtray"
is blowing magnificent spit bubbles.
needs to stop buying things online or she's going to be penniless.
is in lake placid and it's wonderful.
needs to finish her work...but is very lazy.
Can't sleep again.
should give up on art and be a scientist.
has nothing to do today.
should give up on being a scientist and become a cave hermit.
should stop wasting her time, go to college and get a real job.
is too liberal for Canandaigua.
really loves the Fall
"But he hung up the phone slow and sad. Dad said "The worst thing about living here is that you can only kill yourself once.""
looks sick most of the time.
Well, see what you want to see, you should see it all. Well, take what you want from me, you deserve it all. Nine times out of ten our hearts just get dissolved. Well, I want a better place or just a better way to fall.
is trying to find an apartment.
Should probably go to sleep soon..
hasn't been online in a long time
Packing up my crap and moving this week. I can't afford cable or internet service so you'll have to text me if you want to talk to me. My phone number is 747-6371 if you didn't already know.
Bored with things, I need to find something else to focus on obsessively.
just finished drill...8 people fell out
need to do calc
grilling with the battalion
working on calculus
military science III
had to move to delta
There is no squabbling so violent as that between people who accepted an idea yesterday and those who will accept the same idea tomorrow.
back to class
battalion level smoke session at 2130
Calc, History, comp, then chem
height and weight test under bravo
chem and then im done with classes for the day
i hate wednesdays
Adversity causes some men to break, others to break records............ ..back from the gym
ms III class
phone sucks
i apologize for my last status no real smoke session took place...im not sure what it was
no
Dream as if you have forever. Live as if you only have today
going to the gym
Think what a better world it would be if we all, the whole world, had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down on our blankets for a nap...
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
parade practice...worst time of the day
He who strikes first, strikes twice.
It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
anybody who wants to do stx lanes tonight report to delta barracks by 745...full battle rattle..this includes rucksack,lbv with compass and water, dummy rifle, and redlines flashlight..have assault pack in rucksack bring kevlar and pc
going to the gym...hit me up later
Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet
Anyone who can be replaced by a machine deserves to be
may have overworked my abs today...feel torn
The undertaking of a new action brings new strength
going for a long run hit me up later
Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second
I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respond
The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.
The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it
if you want to be a leader try and act like one
There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do.
If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I?And if not now, when?
lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it out
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are
You don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there.
If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one!
.if we wait for the moment when everything,  absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin
getting smoked tonight
I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.
Your toughness is made up of equal parts persistence and experience. You don't so much outrun your opponents as outlast and outsmart them, and the toughest opponent of all is the one inside your head
going on a run
monday..enough said
Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.
I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble
The average estimate themselves by what they do, the above average by what they are
phones dead
running the course, then to the weight room
Personally, I don't think there's intelligent life on other planets. Why should other planets be any different from this one?
Since the house is on fire let us warm ourselves
going to the qm
msc III class..
good day...goodnight
got my battle rattle ready
Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance
Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom
Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work.
Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
Why did I want to win? because I didn't want to lose!
despise the fact i have already been up for almost 3 hours
Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.
I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom
If life gives you lemons - make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it.
Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speak
If you can't convince them, confuse them
first free weekend
The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it
Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.
Here's to you and here's to me, and I hope we never disagree. But, if that should ever be, to HELL with you, here's to ME
Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed
As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing.
It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumps
Common sense is instinct.  Enough of it is genius
finished ruck run
I've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best
Sometimes                            it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge                            hammer
chem test
Dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives
I'm not the greatest; I'm the double greatest. Not only do I knock 'em out, I pick the round.
If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's besides the point. It's simply that I just have to
It seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication, we often suffer from a shortage of listeners
If the path less traveled were the easy path, then all would take it, thus making greatness simply average
People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid
No matter where you go, there you are
There is no point at which you can say, Well, I'm successful now. I might as well take a nap
just got back from rugby and the weight room, going to eat....hit me up later
If                            you're in a fair fight, you didn't plan it properly
Your             problem is that you think you have time
Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.
It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen
Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes
It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it
Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly
Surprise Me
Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.
If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind, what is the significance of a clean desk?
Believing requires action
Between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before
Those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for contemplation in the practice of the active life, while those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life so as to become yet more apt for contemplation
Where am I?
Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking
Man imposes his own limitations, don't set any
We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable
What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it.
Restlessness is dicontent, and discontent is the first neccesity of progress
I cannot have survival as my only goal.  That would be too boring.

the slower we move the faster we die
One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives.
There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it.
Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
Workouts are like brushing my teeth; I don't think about them, I just do them.  The decision has already been made
Leadership is no more confined to process, than writing is to format
Staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity, more audacity, always audacity, his amazing success in life, war, and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have
Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things
not gonna sleep good tonight
No bees, no honey; no work, no money.
that was fun
I hate the expression "What makes him tick."  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm
going to work out..then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in
Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round  remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten
Earlier tonight, I found a picture of Waldo in jail. I didn't think much of it until I realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding
What is opportunity to the man who can't use it?
Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T), the rest of the week says WTF?
The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers
Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, everyday, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be crazy enough to do.
Someday
There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now.
All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.
All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward.
stx on friday hit me up if you want in....The greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place.
Dream Great...Achieve Greatness
Our business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves -- to break our own records, to outstrip our yesterday by our today.
When you aim for perfection, you  discover it's a moving target.

My alarm clock & I had a fight. It wanted me to get up, I refused. Things escalated. Now I'm awake & its broken. Not sure who won the fight
try to learn something about everything and everything about something
think..see. ..act...
A failure establishes only this, that our determination to succeed was not strong enough
Don't always think in a straight line
We do not rise to the level of  our expectations. We fall to the level of our training

Happy new year!
I found God on the corner of 1st and Amistad, where the west was all but won. All alone, smokin' his last cigarette, I said, "Where you been?" He said "Ask anything..."
"So come on, get higher; loosen my lips. Faith and desire in the swing of your hips, just to pull me down hard, and drown me in love..." ? Best song ever. :)
"So maybe it's true that I can't live without you, and maybe two is better than one..."
"My love, I forgive you; you never planned to die - and love, I'll place two pennies over your eyes... And I will love you, after the war. I love you for always, forever more. I will love you, after the war - forever, for always, and more..."
wants to go see AVATAR! Argh! :O
Going down! Faster would be nice, though... :P Haha!
"I thought about him today, and everybody who's seen what he's seen - from a woman on a bus, to a man with a dream. Hey, wake up *PROPNAME*; welcome to the future." C:

Leaving Manitoba Wednesday morning... Not looking forward to it! :(

biting heads off of Barbie dolls. Stress sucks.
My skull
*PROPNAME* is now single? Are you serious? It should read, "*PROPNAME* has been single." Anyway, wanna go out? I'm single.
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweats the nuts. Yet, I'm still single. Must be rotten nuts.
Anyone want to pull some strings so I can get into grad school? Also, anyone want to buy my house so I can go to grad school?
I need to tell people I'm single more often. Two girls talk to me in less than 24 hours. That's like twice as many in the last week. Wow. I feel special. That's why I ride the short bus.
Your mom
Also, what's with facebook exploding? I can't even use this stupid thing anymore. How do I fix my profile? Wait, there it is underneath the couch cushion next to the pocket lint hiding under the chest of drawers over yonder by the bureau
Yes, mosquitos in AK are really this big. It is actual size. The size of a grapefruit. Every summer at least three people die from mosquito bites in AK. We need to do something about Global Warming, the mosquitos are planning a revolt! AKns lives depend on cool temperatures! Please think of the Alaskans!!!

Why doesn't it say "what's on your mind" next to what you write? My mom joke doesn't work without it. It doesn't make sense. How else do you know that your mom is on my mind if it doesn't say "what's on your mind?"
hahahahahah.....I'm off for the next six days! IT IS AWESOME
I got poked. By *PROPNAME*. Normally I think I'd be much more excited about getting poked, but considering the circumstances (i.e. person) I'm not all that excited. In fact, I'm quite the opposite. Sorry bud but it's still a nub. hahahahaha
"I ain't gonna take my pants off!"
5 hours and 20 minutes of daylight today. TGIF now means Thank God It's not Fairbanks. Then again, I'm thankful tomorrow will be longer than today.

Err. Things to not do and people to ignore.
I heard the most awesome phrase last night. If you've heard it before I don't care because this ish is gangsta legit.
I wish the naries would get here. I've got things to do and people to ignore.
Happy Birthday *PROPNAME*!!!
FINALLY!!!
New cockney rhyming slang that i've invented recently. *PROPNAME* (gayness) This is the funniest one I've ever come up with. Why? Because he actually is gay. Reeses Pieces (peace). Please feel free to use. Maybe in a couple years one of them will end up in a movie and I can say. That's totally mine. Like when *PROPNAME*'s stole the idea for my shirt. Bastards. I bought one anyway though. Cause it was cool.

is in a good mood, which is a nice change.
is bored being back home already.
needs something to do.
enjoyed lunch today.
Can't be arsed...

needs something to do tonight.
Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot... But what of the man?
just bought Five Finger Death Punch: The Way of The Fist as well as Breaking *PROPNAME*: Dear Agony, dilemma or what?! Votes below :)

thinks some people really need to learn to act their age.
will engage his brain before asking anyone if they are free on the 14th of February in future ://
i bought it today, but i haven't opened it yet.  actually, i probably won't get to it for another few days since i'll be so busy with moving and setting up everything else.
i belatedly discovered "my so-called" doppelganger while getting my 90s tv fix.
Guess I might start using Facebook more then...So much info to port over.
I just moved everything that was on my Myspace to this "wonderful" site. I really don't even know why. I was bored maybe? I bet I'll hardly ever use it.
Almost killed myself trying to get a piece of non-existent parchment paper from my spider infested basement. Also, why would we buy Amish fruit salad? These are the questions
officially hates interpreting poetry.
Bored...gonna go watch Thundercats on 50". Exciting evening, eh?
I can really see this Dislike button being abused for very ironic purposes... (Now, joy, I get to read Jane Eyre)
In the process of trying to write a masterpiece! (oh, the vanity)
SLEEP...
Gonna read "SHF"
bought "Season 1" of the old Thundercats cartoon; watching the shit out of this old nostalgic favorite right now. On an unrelated note, I have TONS of homework. Looks like a good combination.
Apparently I read better while listening to Pink Floyd. Really helps with stimulating the mind.
Anyone have a need or desire for a (formerly stray) Red Tick Hound Dog?
Reading "A Clockwork Orange", and then on to "Slaughter-House five"...probably
Just slept from 7AM to 5PM @_@. Woops
New (temporary) dog in my house. Concerned about worms, for his sake and Sparky's.
What an ordeal this has been. This dog is killing me. So hard to keep he and Sparky separated too...
Parkour: Not good to practice in the house.
The French have redeemed themselves as a nationality with the invention of Parkour!
I'm going to sleep out of pure boredom. Goodbye for now, conscious world.
Just passed a Mensa practice exam. Did a litlte worse than I should have, due to having misunderstood 2 or 3 questions, and one seemed like a trick. I feel pretty smart right now nonetheless.
Putting up my wonderfully fake tree. It has given me joy (read as pain//hatred) for the past four years now. Now it can grace my livingroom yet again!
Another day gone...so bored, but too uninspired to do anything creative. *sigh* Still gotta write for you *PROPNAME*. Written any more of that?
Starting from chapter one and going from there. Thank you *PROPNAME*!
Well, this poem MIGHT, loosely, imitate *PROPNAME*'s poem... Not sure I used enough imagery
Facebook is very hard to navigate with everything written like a pirate. I'll just have to adjust :)
Mom woke me up today at noon; I was a little peeved. Stayed in bed for about ten minutes and went: Oh shit, it's Christmas isn't it. Completely forgot.
What's with everyone going to bed so early? The night is still within the nadir. The last remnants of the day remain like a youthful child reluctant to mature. Carpe Noctem!
Sleep. I have the ACT in the morning after all...
Just found a word for word modern translation of Othello; Hoorah, Hooray!
is listening to some kickass Russian hip-hop. I have no clue what they're saying, but it's awesome.
Watching a bunch of movies. I'm starting with "The Quiet Earth"
Wow, already a two-hour delay.
Why so early? It was expected, but no school already?! Zippadee zoodah, zippadee day...
Just curious; if I'm so damn annoying with my vocabulary and ideas, might someone tell me why they talk to me exactly?
Yea, so, *PROPNAME*'s reading assignment...not due tomorrow. Just letting you guys know.
what is this, horseville?  because i'm surrounded by naysayers!
I have no phone!  The iPhone 3.1 OS upgrade broke my phone.
My iPhone is down again
Meh.
About to go open source because Windows is <random expletive>.
free hugs.
writing, writing, writing, writing . . . writing.
24 revolutions around the sun. Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
Books are great company, but in all honesty, my apartment is getting a little crowded.
Borderlands, fantasy novel writing, and *PROPNAME*. Yeah, it's been a good day.
Do what you want cause a pirate is free. You are a pirate!
Work work work.
Medication, medication, medication . . . science fiction? Fighting a cold can be interesing.
Suggested song lyrics: I want to be an interplanetary business man, yeah, bringing discounts to the farthest star. I want to be that hyperspace negotiator, making deals on Jupiter and Mars.

Waiting for 'THE CALL OF DUTY'

i guess, time is not right . . .
B-Day Calender is a good appl..u must try it..its simple,user friendly nd moreover,it realy works-i m usin it..
friends list in mafia is filling up to the limit...
nd u know, i met a frend of mine who is presently workin for ZYNGA - yes, the same ZYNGA who made MAFIA WARS....
OMIGAWD, thank YOU

Life s da best teachr..Ironically,som tough lessns r learnd whn life goes through da smoothst of da seas... 1 thought to share:If u want to win frends,make t a point to remembr all f thm.Often,we tend to care for da ones that r closest to us,nd by that way,we move farther away from da others.. Like someone said,friendship s like a china..beautiful in itself,but once broken,will leave traces even if its glued back..
reached my 500 limit in MAFIA..and continuing up... a special thanks to all mafia frends...

The bike home for lunch is rather exhilarating when oversized truck make right turns from the left lane, without turn signals.  At least do it when the light is green maybe?
Finally decided on a new name for kitty! Sassafras :)

just got a kitten!!!  Any name ideas for the itty bitty kitty?
mmmm. . . cannibalism day in my dead ppl class :)
extends special thanks to *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*!  Now on to the literature review ...
is enjoying the cricket...comfy boxers and rainy weather...is it too soon for a beer?
can't believe that her son walked up to the Christmas tree stating 'J'. I was a little confused until he took a candy cane off the tree and proceeded to turn it upside down :-D
got home from shopping all evening (*PROPNAME* and kids in tow) and then wrapped presents all night...and it still isnt finished...*yawn*
- so, this morning *PROPNAME* gets up to play and he goes over to the carpet where the light was shining through the blinds casting shadows...he then proceeds to tell me the different letters the sun is making on the carpet... 'I', 'T' and 'L' to be exact! He then somehow figured out how to cast his shadow over the sun to make the letters change & disappear! At this rate, he will be smarter than me before he goes to school!
needs beer...actually, any kind of alcohol will do...
is sick of being sick!
is enjoying the cricket but has no fingernails left.
would like the rain back!
had a great day yesterday thanks to aunties babysitting :0)
I did the Macarena with a pickle at the dinner table because the voices told me to.
So...*PROPNAME* can now count backwards from 10 :-)
So...apparently, according to urban dictionary...A women named *PROPNAME* is typically very beautiful with an incredible body and nice eyes. They are known to be very loveable. *PROPNAME* are envied by other women...haha...I wish!
Preparing the different meals I can eat for my "bulking" diet with my custom workout program starting Tuesday. In theory this should be better than P90X, HIT, 5x5, etc. Counting calories is tedious, but it's the best way to make real progress.

I was totally freaked out tonight while driving home with Janice at 12am. The black coupe next to me matched my speed even though I was going fast and then he continued to match me speed as I slowed down. So I turn to look at the driver of the car and he's wearing a mask. A rubber mask reminiscent to freddy cruger. 0_0 I almost had a heart attack. I then slowed down a lot and he continued on... oh my goodness...
In my 10 min stop at 85*C bakery in Irvine, I saw 4 people I knew...
Then at Costco tonight, I find out my atm card is blocked due to potential fraud. Now I need to stop by the bank tomorrow for a temporary card... I wonder if this qualifies for fml...

Question: What would have happened if Adam and Eve had eaten from the "Tree of Life" before eating from the "Tree of Knowledge"?
I think *PROPNAME* is quite a little beuity.
I'm ecstatic! I just spoke briefly with *PROPNAME*'s lawyer. Based on some "case files" I emailed her, we have enough evidence to prove CPS's removal of the kids was illegal and grounds for an emergency hearing. We believe we have enough evidence to cost both CPS and Humble PD their "qualified immunity", allowing us to file a civil suit against them and the apartments. ANYONE KNOW A GOOD CIVIL ATTORNEY???
*PROPNAME*'s kids won in KBXX-97.9 "MADD HATTA'S ELVES" Christmas contest. They get to go to an invitation only Christmas party at Dave & Busters Monday morning. Unfortunately. *PROPNAME*'s daddy does not want to let him go because of all the CPS stuff.
Things went better. *PROPNAME* was able to retain her composur and not break down in court. The judge referred the case to "mediation". We go to that Jan 29th.
Lord willing and with his blessing. I claim in the name of Jesus: "Today we get the kids back." All Prayers are welcome.
Please keep *PROPNAME*'s family in your prayers tonight and tomorrow. We have to be in court at 9am. Really pray for the oldest *PROPNAME* went to his dad's for his summer visit and had his mother, brother and sister stripped from him for six months. CPS is providing Christmas for the other two but not him.  I sure hope we succeed at stripping them of their "immunity" and make them pay for what they've done to this family.
I stopped by and visited with *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*. Only stayed about twenty minutes. I sure will be glad when they can come back home.
Well we are on hold until next Wed. Both CASA and CPS are demanding current prescription records all though they have through the last court date and did not request these until yesterday. *PROPNAME*'s theropist did not show either, but he is being supenaed for Wed.
*PROPNAME* just told me Tuesday, that her cancer has progressed to stage 4.
Could teenage "Huffing" be the result of modern day child proofing and the parent neglecting to actually teach the child, "THAT WILL KILL YOU".
Can anyone out there tell me if Jesus was EVER anointed in OIL? He was babtized in water and anointed in the Holy Spirt which is why he is called the "anointed one". Can anyone tell me yes or no. If yes I need scripture reference. Thank you.
Go Gators! 8 and 0.... Now, lets see if the Vols help us clench the SEC east :) oh, and HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!
enjoyed the football and fun of the weekend, and now its back to reality.
I love Mondays.... can every one grasp the sarcasm in that statement. I hope so.
I don't understand why some people make it so hard for you to be nice to them. I dont understand why I'm worrying about it anyway, they sure aren't.
Thanksgiving cooking! Fun or stressful, I'll decide later.
ITS FRIDAY!
To my veteran friends, family, and strangers alike; I would like to say Thank You. Thank you for the sacrifices you have made for my safety, my freedoms, and my country. God Bless you all.
just can't get into the Monay state of mind.
Who can tell me how to not be a fan of something anymore?
I don't want to get sick, but I think it's happening anyway :(
Can't decided if she is going to Jacksonville Saturday or not.
Hooray! Home from work.
What was LSU thinking?
Do you remember that song "Break Stuff" by Limp Bizkit? Thats kind of the day I'm having.
Back to work. Trying to get everything cleaned up before the New Year. If you saw my desk, you would understand why I am starting now :)
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
People should not encourage me to drink until 4 o'clock in the morning :(
and the Bucs pull it out in Overtime! Way to go!
*PROPNAME* leaves the SEC, HOORAY
I have SO happy the Ravens are getting a good start today! I love playoff football.
I'm getting calls back on my resume, it makes me hopefull I will find the right job :)
I just can't get into the swing of things today.
What sad news for the Gator nation today, the resignation of Urban Meyer. Our prayers will be with Coach Meyer and his family.
Upon what basis do we judge other people? Is it ithe experiances that we ourselves have, or the belifes in which we hold?

I know many people have faced this issue before, but MIT Graduate Admissions should stop denying the existence of Caltech...
According to a certain oil//gas industry recruiter, 3.4 < 3.0.
It's creepy how facebook suggests that a certain friend has too few friends.
It's really irksome when a grad school application recognizes 'California Institute of Locksmithing' but not 'California Institute of Technology.'
Contra Costa County is now recruiting prison cooks at Caltech.  I didn't know they needed prison cooks that badly.  Besides, there's probably a 3.5 GPA requirement somewhere...
We consider a pure gas composed of rigid, nonattracting spherical molecules of diameter d and mass m, and the number density (number of molecules per unit volume) is taken to be n.
Apparently "California Institute of Technology" is too long a name for MIT Graduate Admissions.
The moral of Ninja Assassins: if you're ever attacked by black pajama-clad assassins, your only chance of survival is riding in a Volkswagen Eos.
just realized that it's cheaper to run his car on lard in Texas ($6.22//gallon) than on diesel ($6.77//gallon) in the UK.
I love how Techers are always tagged as "The Smart One."
told the guy behind the fish counter to gut a catfish by mimicing longitudinal write slices.
Fun( baiting Russian trolls) > Fun( baiting generic trolls)
What's this song I'm hearing on the radio with sirens, screams and gunshots?  Oh right, it's "Santa Claus is Coming to Town."
Good thing Caltech doesn't have a front gate; otherwise, someone would write "Wirklichkeit Macht Frei" on top.
My family now has 1 car//person, down from 1.25 cars//person.
The AeroPress is back in business.  America, fuck yeah!
9//9.  Finally done.
My 2005 *PROPNAME* has a ridiculously sharp throttle response.  I wonder if it has anything to do with the unintended acceleration problems...
wonders why engineers are overrepresented in terrorist organizations.
Mass Effect 2: It's nice to see that the Nigerian 419 scam is still going strong in 2184, this time with Batarians trying to recover quarantined Prothean artifacts.
I don't know why new car dealers in Houston insist on all-season tires on all their products.  We have snow one day every 3 years!
Note to 'The Wildlife Fund': Fuck you, stop pestering me about your $500 'donation' to my nonexistent 'zoo'.
Dear BioWare: Dragon Age is a wonderful and entertaining game, but epic fail on the load times.  At least make the wait entertaining.  Instead of blood tracks on a map (or awkward elevator rides), how about a 2D hack 'n slash minigame?
