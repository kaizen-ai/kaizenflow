# Title: Simple Data Analysis With SQLAlchamey ORM

## Description:
My "Simple Data Analysis With SQLAlchemy ORM" project consist of a Jupyter notebook that integrates a SQLite database with Python using SQLAlchemy and SQLAlchemy ORM. The project examines missing value counts per column in the "Tweets" table, and has an interactive bar graph illustrating negative reviews across various categories for airlines like Delta, United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest, US Airways, and Virgin America. Also, the project involves constructing a Logistic Regression Model to classify tweets into specific negative sentiment categories.
