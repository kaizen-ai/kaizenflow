Hello!

Nice to meet you.

We are very happy that you are interested in the
[Sorrentum Project](https://www.sorrentum.org/)!

The project aims to combine open-source development, startups, and brilliant
students. We’ve seen this mixture of ingredients work exceptionally well at
Stanford / Berkeley / MIT / etc, where every student seems to be trying to start
a company on the side. Our goal is to bootstrap the same virtuous cycle at UMD
so that instead of just looking for a job, you create your own.

We are still figuring out things as we go, and we are working with UMD and other
interested parties to provide research assistantships and grants. Besides the
immediate financial benefit, this is a unique opportunity for you to:

- work on cutting-edge problems on machine learning and Web3
- learn about startups and how to start your own project
- write academic papers
- get internships and full-time positions at companies working on Sorrentum
  applications or from our network

Most importantly, this is a unique way to be part of a community of individuals
interested in building innovative products.

# First steps

1. Fill out this initial
   [Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6IogJch1YUMSc_GfRcMIltGEEZ1xTotbRVkwZzWT7eBz_jA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
   It's meant to just get basic details about you.

2. Accept the invite from GitHub that we will send you

   - The invite is in your email or at
     https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum/invitations
   - Please fork, star, watch the Sorrentum repo so that GitHub promotes our
     repo (we gotta work the system)

3. Take a look at the list of interesting projects
   [Project List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELLDf7dg3nli6nLYMpQ9IxuTW5dYdN15nluNCZbZmD4/edit)

   - Don't worry about immediately finding a project you want to work on, this
     is just to let you see what we're working on
   - If any of the projects immediately interest you, please comment interested
     (e.g., by adding the word INTERESTED close to the task)

4. Please fill out the
   [Project Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRDe4gdPi6hYElea6g5Eg_xGfVorn667lEaDIhA4kuWCCC_g/viewform?usp=sf_link)
   so we know a little about you and your (initial) skills

   - Don’t worry: by working with us, you will soon become a coding machine

5. Make sure the info on the
   [Task List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRZJaj5-1g6W7w_Ay4UhJEdtAvrTTM1V94cKj6_Vwoc/edit#gid=1253964093)
   are correct

   - E.g., especially email, GitHub account, and Telegram handle
   - If something is incorrect, please tell us in
     [this form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpChQbfcbIBr8izCj5Bl3VdSCQLOGqAJMPXwfsiBBABicyVw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

6. Open this
   [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btjCFRJHWIZcmMv3lk2Rn4-jSUQBb0hS-97PFvy4fgo/edit?usp=sharing)
   to access the invite links for the different team groups

7. Communication will happen through:

   - GitHub on the [repo](https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum) like in a
     open-source development
   - a Telegram IM channel for higher bandwidth discussion

8. We have research office hours twice a week over Zoom to discuss typically 2
   projects
   - The current hours are:
     - Every Tue 3 to 3:45pm ET
     - Every Fri 2 to 2:45pm ET
   - The link is: Zoom (see invitation)

# IMPORTANT

This is our only request to you.

We understand that due to classes and other commitments, you might not be able
to work on Sorrentum consistently. That’s ok. At the same time, please be aware
that taking on a task means that:

1. the same task might not be available to your colleagues; and

2. we spend time helping, training, and mentoring you
   - So the energy we put into helping you will be taken away from your
     colleagues
   - If you give up our effort could have been better used for other teammates
     that committed more firmly to making progress

In other words, if you are not sure you can commit a meaningful amount of time
to Sorrentum (e.g., 10 hours / week), it is wise to wait to be sure you can do
it. If you are excited and want to start, go for it, do your best, and we’ll
make this experience the best possible for you.
