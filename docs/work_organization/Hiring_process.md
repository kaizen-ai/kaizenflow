# HiringMeister

## Find candidates

We get candidates in several ways

- Send emails to CS and related depts
  - Especially for PhD students

- Use our LinkedIn pipeline to find candidates
  - We are going to start targeting graduates from top schools

- Post job on LinkedIn

- Post job on Upwork

## Initial screening

- HiringMeister: upon receipt of applications for new positions, track
  applicants add task to Asana "Candidates"
  - For each task description use the template
    https://app.asana.com/0/1204526145297526/1207748235019119/f

- HiringMeister: send email to gather additional information from candidates
  - Ask candidates to fill out the questionnaire form
    [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-iegytm5t1w-LPs7gm8IuUHTxi3cKI2iqzlPKdanWqY/edit#response=ACYDBNiZxM_bkXREaYEijJzedNrMRFiuzfuGgMQLE2W8qnzXnC1UcYAd8SbnXWHKAA)
  - Results are

## Hiring committee

- Every 2 weeks the screening committee conducts a meeting to review the
  applicants
  - Everyone on the committee collects all the information needed to make a
    decision
  - TODO(gp): This needs to be formalized better

- We want to increase the quality of the collaborators, so if there is a red
  flag (e.g., no GitHub, low GPA, undergrad) we can decide to not on-board
  - The goal is to avoid on-boarding people that will likely disappoint us

- If we receive a single candidate application and find no red flags in the
  profile, we should proceed further in the process
  - It's ok to ask more team members to take a look

- If the candidate is a no-go, GP sends an email of rejection

## Mentors

- Hiring Meisters (e.g., Sonaal and Samarth) supervise the hiring process
  - [docs/onboarding/kaizenflow.hiring_meister.how_to_guide.md](https://github.com/kaizen-ai/kaizenflow/blob/master/docs/onboarding/kaizenflow.hiring_meister.how_to_guide.md)

- Coding mentors are:
  - Hiring Meisters
  - Anybody who is not in some critical path (e.g., Dan, Danya, Toma)

## Onboarding pipeline

- Once a candidate is accepted we assign a mentor on Asana
  - The mentor is in charge to intervene when the candidate is blocked
  - We track the mentor in Asana

- We use Asana tasks to communicate about the candidates

- There are multiple pipeline stages on Asana that candidates go through
  - **Candidates**
    - Anybody who wants to join our project/company
  - **On-boarding on KaizenAI**
    - _Goal_: set up candidates to work on their laptop on KaizenAI
    - _Duration_: few days
    - The checklist for onboarding on KaizenAI is
      [here](/docs/onboarding/kaizenflow.hiring_meister.how_to_guide.md#on-boarding-bug-creation)
    - Once the checklist is complete, candidates move to the next step
  - **Working on KaizenAI**
    - _Goal_: understand who can/should join the team
    - _Duration_: 1 month
    - _Type of tasks_: unit tests
    - Each candidate should work on 2-3 issues to make sure we can judge how
      good is a candidate
    - We score candidates every 2 weeks for a few iterations until we can make a
      decision
    - Candidates who are good enough can be onboarded on cmamp, otherwise are
      dropped
  - **On-boarding on cmamp**
    - _Goal_: set up candidates to develop on cmamp (only on the server)
    - _Duration_: few days
    - The checklist for onboarding on cmamp is
      [here](http://docs/onboarding/all.onboarding_checklist.md)
    - On-boarding GH issue on cmamp
  - **Working on cmamp**
    - _Goal_: learn our development process
    - _Duration_: 1 month
    - _Type of tasks_: unit tests (stuff that doesnâ€™t require design)
    - After that we can assign the best hires to teams
  - **Full-time or interns on probation**
    - _Goal_: contribute to KaizenAI or cmamp
    - _Duration_: 3 months
    - _Type of tasks_: unit test, refactoring, simple non-design tasks
    - Assign them to teams
    - Give them more complex task
  - **Full-time team members**
    - Normal workflow
  - **Team leaders**
    - Type of tasks: in charge of architecture, big picture, real-time systems
    - For the ones that are able to master the process

## Onboarding GH Issues

We want to have a pipeline of GH Issues to assign people as soon as they are
ready
