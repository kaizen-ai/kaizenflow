# Contributor - Scorecard

Thank you for joining the Sorrentum project and contributing to it.

We give feedback about every 2 weeks. The scores are published [<span
class="underline">here</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a8ypuO2ODOzjp9BaRN23HWa5P7ruTKs_gHZWaPYsvy4/edit#gid=2082207396)

Some reminders

- The goal of this internship is to bridge the gap between college and the
  workplace. We try to give you a preview of how your skills will be evaluated
  and prepare you for being hired. As you have seen, we spend a lot of time
  helping you improve your skills through code reviews, writing documentation,
  suggesting resources to read, etc

- The purpose of these evaluations is to support your professional development.
  Embracing feedback positively and actively working on areas that need
  improvement will not only benefit your internship but also contribute to your
  overall growth as a professional

- Multiple people review your work and assess it as objectively as possible, so
  please don't question your scores, but rather try to understand why you
  receive the feedback and focus on how to improve the scores

- We are a non-profit open source project so we have limited capacity and time.
  We give an opportunity to contribute to everyone, but we can't support
  contributors that don't contribute enough to the project

  - A score of 4 or higher is considered contributing, indicating a good
    performance

  - If your score falls below 4, please focus on improving in areas you are
    lacking. Your mentor (indicated in the Google Sheet) can provide you
    guidance for improving on Telegram. Feel free to have a short discussion
    with them.

  - Contributors that have a score less than 3 will be given a warning and if
    they can't increase their score, they will be dropped from the project. Our
    decision is final, everybody had a fair shot, but we can't have dragged on
    discussions. In life, you have only one chance to give a first impression.
    After you are dropped, you can take 6 months off to improve your skills and
    then apply to contribute for the project again
