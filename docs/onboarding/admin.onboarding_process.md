# On-boarding Process

1. A candidate (intern or full-time candidate) submits a request

- The `ResearchMeister` gets the notification from the submission Gsheet and
  creates an Asana task under `Not started` with:
  - Name (nickname) email
  - E.g, `Yuanxuan ****** <yuanxuan@*******.edu>`
  - Put the form links, the GitHub account, the LinkedIn / CV link, etc. in the
    Asana description (all the info that we typically need to access quickly)
  - Google form: ?
  - CV / LinkedIn: ?
  - GitHub handle: ?
  - Email: ?
  - Telegram handle: ?
  - Devops candidate: Yes / no
  - Intern vs Full-time candidate: ?
  - Quick review if the person has the skills we are looking for
  - Assign to a shepherd
    - If interns -> Samarth/Sonaal
    - If full-time candidate -> shepherd
    - If not clear ask GP

2. The shepherd reviews the CV to get a sense if they are decent or not
   - It posts a quick summary of pros and cons
   - We want to increase the quality of the collaborators, so if there is a red
     flag we can decide to not on-board
   - If you are uncertain, ask more people to take a look
   - The goal is to avoid on-boarding collaborators that will likely disappoint
     us

3. If the candidate is a no go, GP sends an email of rejection
4. The on-boarding shepherd is in charge of updating the Asana task with every
   interesting event
5. We start the on-boarding process as per

   - Update the
     [Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRZJaj5-1g6W7w_Ay4UhJEdtAvrTTM1V94cKj6_Vwoc/edit#gid=1253964093)
   - Copy the information from
     [Contributor Info](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Mxj5ZIydMQHSmJUDCpURB5w-50RPXC0AjgKWYcMZnw/edit#gid=2038824432)
     response sheet to the
     [Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRZJaj5-1g6W7w_Ay4UhJEdtAvrTTM1V94cKj6_Vwoc/edit#gid=1253964093)
     as it is a master sheet for all the collaborators
   - Ping GP on the Asana task for that collaborator for invitation to the repo
   - Add Contributor email as Commenter to the
     [KaizenFlow - Contributors gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LXwKpmaFWJI-887IoA50sVC8-dw_1L8I)

6. When the collaborator is ready to be on-boarded, file an issue like
   "On-board <FIRST NAME LAST NAME>"
   - The content of the issue will be the following checklist (note that GitHub
     needs full paths to point to the documentation from an issue)
     ```
     - [ ] Acknowledge the pledge to put effort and time in the project [here](/README.md#commitment-to-contribute)
     - [ ] Fork, star, watch the KaizenFlow repo so that GitHub promotes our repo (we gotta spread the work)
     - [ ] Read and execute [set up development environment](/docs/onboarding/kaizenflow.set_up_development_environment.how_to_guide.md)
     - [ ] Read and start internalizing [KaizenFlow Python coding style guide](/docs/coding/all.coding_style.how_to_guide.md)
     - [ ] Read about your [first code review](/docs/coding/all.submit_code_for_review.how_to_guide.md)
     - [ ] Peruse the map of [all the documentation](/docs/onboarding/all.development_documents.reference.md)
     - [ ] Learn about our [org process](/docs/work_organization/all.team_collaboration.how_to_guide.md)
     - [ ] Get assigned a warm-up issue
     - If you are graduating soon and you would like to get a full-time job in
       one of the companies in the KaizenFlow ecosystem reach out to GP at
       gp@kaizen-tech.io
     ```
   - Admins need to keep track on the progress being made by the collaborator.

7. We score candidates every two weeks
