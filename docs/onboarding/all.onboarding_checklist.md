## Onboarding process for a new team member

### Meta

#### Make on-boarding automatic

- We want to make the onboarding process as automatic as possible

#### Be patient

- Let's use all the communication tools we have (screen sharing, Google Meet,
  phone, Telegram, email) to keep the process smooth and personal
- There are many (hidden) dependencies in the process, so something will
  inevitably go wrong
  - Let's all be patient with each other

#### Ask for confirmation

- Use checklists any time to make sure things get done
- Ask for confirmation of all the actions, e.g.,
  - "Does this and that work?"
  - "Did you receive the email?"
  - "Can you log in?"
- Make the new team member follow the instructions so that they can get familiar
  with the systems

#### Make on-boarding similar to our work routine

- Provide tools for interacting with the team
  - During the process the new teammate will ask questions and he / she should
    use the appropriate tools for each type of communication
    - Telegram: only for interactive communications
    - GitHub issues: for coding related things
    - Asana tasks: for business/high-level tasks
    - Email: everything else

- We want to nudge a new hire to operate through the tools we use during our
  daily work
  - That is why we asking him to create a first issue about his / her experience
    with the process
  - He / she should put his / her notes in the GH issue while proceeding during
    the onboarding process

#### Improve on-boarding process

- Review, improve, clarify process
  - We want to point the new team member to a document rather than explaining
    over and over the same things
  - Always keep this document updated, ask candidates to follow it carefully,
    and update it with a PR
  - We want to use each new team-member experience to improve our workflow
  - We want new team-members to improve the existing documentation using our
    standard GitHub process

- Have the new team member:
  - Open the first GitHub bug on the first day
  - Open the first PR by the second day

### People involved in the on-boarding
