## Run unit tests

- We use `pytest` and `unittest` as testing framework
- Before any PR (and ideally after a few commits), we want to run all the unit
  tests to make sure we didn't introduce any new bugs

### Test lists

- We have different test set lists:
  - `fast`
    - Tests that are quick to execute (typically less than 5 secs per test
      class)
    - We want to run these tests before/after every commit/PR to make sure
      things are not broken
  - `slow`
    - Tests that we don't want to run all the times because they are:
      - Slow (typically less than 20 seconds per test)
      - They are related to pieces of code that don't change often
        - E.g., external APIs we don't want to hit continuously
  - `superslow`
    - Tests that run long workload, e.g., running a production model, a long
      simulation
    - No time limit but we need to be judicious with length
      - Anything above 5-15 mins is problematic

### Using `invoke`

- [`invoke`](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) is a task execution framework which
  allows to execute some typical workflows in a simple way
- In our config script `invoke` is aliased to `i` to reduce typing
- E.g., we use it to run the test suites:

  ```bash
  # Run only fast tests.
  > i run_fast_tests
  # Run only slow tests.
  > i run_slow_test
  # Run only superslow tests.
  > i run_superslow_tests
  ```

- To see the options use `--help` option, e.g. `i --help run_fast_tests`:

  ```bash
  Usage: inv[oke] [--core-opts] run_fast_tests [--options] [other tasks here ...]

  Docstring:
    Run fast tests.
    :param stage: select a specific stage for the Docker image
    :param pytest_opts: option for pytest
    :param skip_submodules: ignore all the dir inside a submodule
    :param coverage: enable coverage computation
    :param collect_only: do not run tests but show what will be executed
    :param tee_to_file: save output of pytest in `tmp.pytest.log`
    :param kwargs: kwargs for `ctx.run`

  Options:
    -c, --coverage
    -k, --skip-submodules
    -o, --collect-only
    -p STRING, --pytest-opts=STRING
    -s STRING, --stage=STRING
    -t, --tee-to-file
    -v STRING, --version=STRING
  ```

#### Docker image stage and version

- To select a specific stage for Docker image use the `--stage` option. E.g.,
  this might be useful when a user wants to run regressions on the local Docker
  image to verify that nothing is broken before promoting it to `dev` image.

  ```bash
  > i run_fast_tests --stage local
  ```

- To run the tests on the specific version of a Docker image, use the
  `--version` option.
  - E.g., this might be useful when releasing a new version of an image.
    ```bash
    > i run_fast_tests --stage local --version 1.0.4
    ```

#### Specifying `pytest` options

- With the option `--pytest-opts` it is possible to pass any `pytest` option to
  `invoke`.

#### Running in debug mode

- If a user wants to run the tests in debug mode to show the output
  ```bash
  > i run_fast_tests -s --dbg
  ```
- This is equivalent to specifying `-v DEBUG` through the command line of one of
  the executables

#### Save test output to a file

- To save the output of `pytest` to `tmp.pytest.log` use the `--tee-to-file`
  option.
  ```bash
  > i run_fast_tests --tee-to-file
  ```

#### Show the tests but do not run

- To list, but not run, the tests that will be executed, use `--collect-only`.
  ```bash
  > i run_fast_test --collect-only
  ```

#### Skip submodules

- To skip running tests in submodules, use the `--skip-submodules` option.
- This option is useful in repos with Git submodules so that you can run only
  the tests specific to the repo, skipping the tests in the submodule
  - E.g., to run only the tests in `dev_tools` but not in `cmamp` (which is a
    submodule)
    ```bash
    > cd dev_tools1
    > i run_fast_tests --skip-submodules
    ```

#### Compute test coverage

- To compute test coverage use the `--coverage` option

  ```bash
  > i run_fast_tests --coverage
  ```

### Timeout

- We use the [`pytest-timeout`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-timeout/)
  package to limit durations of fast, slow, and superslow tests
- The timeout durations for each test type are listed
  [here](#running-unit-tests)
- The timeout restricts the running time of the test methods, including
  `set_up_test()` and `tear_down_test()` time, if they are run at the
  beginning/end of the methods

### Rerunning timeout-ed tests

- Running tests can take different amounts of time depending on workload and
  machine
- Because of this, we rerun failing tests using
  [`pytest-rerunfailures`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-rerunfailures/)
- `pytest-rerunfailures` is not completely compatible with `pytest-timeout`.
  This is why we have to add the `-o timeout_func_only=true` flag to
  `pytest-timeout`. See
  [https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-rerunfailures/issues/99](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-rerunfailures/issues/99)` `for
  more information
- We rerun time outed fast tests twice and time outed slow and superslow tests
  once
- There is a
  [way](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-rerunfailures/#re-run-individual-failures)
  to provide a rerun delay for individual tests. However, we can’t use it for
  now due to
  [#693 (comment)](https://github.com/cryptokaizen/cmamp/issues/693#issuecomment-989456031)

### Compute test coverage

- The documentation for `coverage` is
  [here](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmd.html#reporting).

- Run a set of unit tests enabling coverage:

  ```bash
  # Run the coverage for a single test:
  > i run_fast_tests --coverage -p oms/test/test_broker.py::TestSimulatedBroker1

  # Run coverage for an entire module like `oms`:
  > i run_fast_tests --coverage -p oms
  ```

- This generates and runs a pytest command inside Docker like:

  ```bash
  docker> /venv/bin/pytest -m "not slow and not superslow" oms/test/test_broker.py::TestSimulatedBroker1 --cov=. --cov-branch --cov-report term-missing --cov-report html
  ```

- Which generates:
  - A default coverage report
  - A binary `.coverage` file that contains the coverage information
  - An `htmlcov` dir with a browsable code output to inspect the coverage for
    the files

- One can post-process the coverage report in different ways using the command
  `coverage` inside a docker container, since the code was run (as always)
  inside the Docker container that contains all the dependencies.

  ```bash
  > coverage -h

- To open the line coverage from outside Docker, go with your browser to
  `htmlcov/index.html`. The `htmlcov` is re-written with every coverage run with
  the `--cov-report html` option. If you move out `index.html` from `htmlcov`
  dir some html features (e.g., filtering) will not work.

  ```bash
  # On macOS:
  > open htmlcov/index.html
  ```

- By clicking on a file you can see which lines are not covered

#### An example coverage session

- We want to measure the unit test coverage of `oms` component from both fast
  and slow tests

- We start by running the fast tests:

  ```bash
  # Run fast unit tests
  > i run_fast_tests --coverage -p oms
  collected 66 items / 7 deselected / 59 selected
  ...

  # Compute the coverage for the module sorting by coverage
  docker> coverage report --include="oms/*" --omit="*/test_*.py" --sort=Cover

  ```

- We see that specific files have low coverage, so we want to see what is not
  covered.

- Generate the same report in a browsable format

  ```bash
  docker> rm -rf htmlcov; coverage html --include="oms/*" --omit="*/test_*.py"
  # Wrote HTML report to `htmlcov/index.html`

  > open htmlcov/index.html
  ```

- The low coverage for `tasks.py` and `oms_lib_tasks.py` is due to the fact that
  we are running code through invoke that doesn't allow `coverage` to track it.

- Now, we run the coverage for the slow tests

  ```bash
  # Save the coverage from the fast tests run
  > cp .coverage .coverage_fast_tests

  > i run_slow_tests --coverage -p oms
  collected 66 items / 59 deselected / 7 selected

  > cp .coverage .coverage_slow_tests

  > coverage report --include="oms/*" --omit="*/test_*.py" --sort=Cover

- We see that the coverage from the slow tests is only 23% for 7 tests

  ```bash
  docker> coverage combine .coverage_fast_tests .coverage_slow_tests
  Combined data file .coverage_fast_tests
  Combined data file .coverage_slow_tests
  ```

#### An example with customized `pytest-cov` html run

- We want to measure unit test coverage specifically for one test in
  `im_v2/common/data/transform/` and to save generated `htmlcov` in the same
  directory.

- Run the command below after `i docker_bash`:

  ```bash
  docker> pytest --cov-report term-missing
    --cov=im_v2/common/data/transform/ im_v2/common/data/transform/test/test_transform_utils.py
    --cov-report html:im_v2/common/data/transform/htmlcov \
  ```

- Output sample:

  ```bash

#### Generate coverage report with `invoke`

- One can compute test coverage for a specified directory and generate text and
  HTML reports automatically using `invoke task run_coverage_report`

  ```bash
  > i --help run_coverage_report
  INFO: > cmd='/data/grisha/src/venv/amp.client_venv/bin/invoke --help run_coverage_report'

  Usage: inv[oke] [--core-opts] run_coverage_report [--options] [other tasks here ...]

  Docstring:

    Compute test coverage stats.

  :param target_dir: directory to compute coverage stats for running-unit-tests
  :param generate_html_report: whether to generate HTML coverage report or not
  :param publish_html_on_s3: whether to publish HTML coverage report or not
  :param aws_profile: the AWS profile to use for publishing HTML report

  Options:
    -a STRING, --aws-profile=STRING
    -g, --[no-]generate-html-report
    -p, --[no-]publish-html-on-s3
    -t STRING, --target-dir=STRING
  ```

##### Common usage

- Compute coverage for `market_data` dir, generate text and HTML reports and
  publish HTML report on S3

  ```bash
  > i run_coverage_report --target-dir market_data

  Wrote HTML report to htmlcov/index.html

  ```

#### Publishing HTML report on S3

- To make a dir with the report unique, we decorate the dir with a linux user
  and a Git branch name, e.g.,
  `html_coverage/grisha_CmTask1038_Tool_to_extract_the_dependency_from_a_project`
  - `html_coverage` is the common dir on S3 for coverage reports
- After publishing the report, one can easily open it via a local web browser
  - See the details in
    [htmlcov server](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JWAbNLuwseLAleW1wQ0BH8gxHEA9Hb9ZRgAy-Ooj9-M/edit#heading=h.58pd2t5yyzlw)
  - E.g.
    [http://172.30.2.44/html_coverage/grisha_CmTask1038_Tool_to_extract_the_dependency_from_a_project/](http://172.30.2.44/html_coverage/grisha_CmTask1038_Tool_to_extract_the_dependency_from_a_project/)

## Running `pytest` directly

### Usage and Invocations reference

- See [`pytest` documentation](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html)
- Some examples of useful command lines:

  ```bash
  # Stop at first failure
  > pytest -x

  # Run a single class
  > pytest -k TestPcaFactorComputer1

  # Run a single test method
  > pytest core/test/test_core.py::TestPcaFactorComputer1::test_linearize_eigval_eigvec

  # Remove cache artifacts

  > find . -name "__pycache__" -o -name ".pytest_cache"
  ./.pytest_cache
  ./dev_scripts/test/Test_linter_py1.test_linter1/tmp.scratch/__pycache__
  ./dev_scripts/test/__pycache__
  ./dev_scripts/__pycache__

  > find . -name "__pycache__" -o -name ".pytest_cache" | xargs rm -rf

  # Run with a clear cache
  > pytest --cache-clear

  # Run the tests that last failed (this data is stored in .pytest_cache/v/cache/lastfailed)
  > pytest --last-failed
  ```

### Custom `pytest` options behaviors

#### Enable logging

- To enable logging of `_LOG.debug` for a single test run:

  ```bash
  # Enable debug info
  > pytest oms/test/test_broker.py::TestSimulatedBroker1 -s --dbg
  ```

#### Update golden outcomes

- This switch allows to overwrite the golden outcomes that are used as reference
  in the unit tests to detect failures

  ```bash
  > pytest --update_outcomes
  ```

#### Incremental test mode

- This switch allows to reuse artifacts in the test directory and to skip the
  clean up phase

- It is used to rerun tests from the middle when they are very long and one
  wants to debug them

  ```bash
  > pytest --incremental
  ```

### Debugging Notebooks

1. Run a failing test with `-s --dbg` to get detailed logs
   - E.g., `> pytest core/plotting/test/test_gallery_notebook.py -s --dbg`
2. From the logs take a `run_notebook.py` script command that was run by the
   test
   - E.g., starting like
     `/app/dev_scripts/notebooks/run_notebook.py --notebook ...`
3. Append ` --no_suppress_output` to this command and run it again directly from
   the bash
   - E.g., like
     `> /app/dev_scripts/notebooks/run_notebook.py --notebook ... --no_suppress_output`
4. Scroll up the logs and see a report about the problem, notebooks failures
   will be displayed as well
   - E.g.,
     <img width="756" src="https://github.com/kaizen-ai/kaizenflow/assets/31514660/43a2854e-ae4e-450d-95fd-f16df0a53c79">

## Running tests on GH Actions

- The official documentation is
  [https://docs.github.com/en/actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

### How to run a single test on GH Action

- Unfortunately, there is no way to log in and run interactively on GH machines.
  This is a feature requested but not implemented by GH yet.

- All the code to run GH Actions is in the `.github` directory in `lemonade` and
  `amp`.

- E.g., to run a single test in the fast test target, instead of the entire
  regression suite

1. You can modify `.github/workflows/fast_tests.yml`, by replacing

   ```bash
   # run: invoke run_fast_tests
   run: invoke run_fast_tests --pytest-opts="helpers/test/test_git.py::Test_git_modified_files1::test_get_modified_files_in_branch1 -s --dbg"
   ```
   - Note that the indentation matters since it's a YAML file

     ![alt_text](figs/unit_tests/image_3.png)
   - The `-s --dbg` is to show `_LOG.debug` in case you care about that to get
     more information

2. Commit the code to your branch (not in master, please) since GH runs each
   branch independently
3. Kick-off manually the fast test through the GH interface
4. After debugging, you can revert the change from your branch to `master` and
   move along with the usual PR flow
