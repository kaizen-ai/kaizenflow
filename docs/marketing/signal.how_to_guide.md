# How to extract data from Signal

## Locations

- The module is located at `marketing/signal`
- An example notebook is at
  `marketing/notebooks/SorrTask612_Get_information_from_Signal.ipynb`

## Dataflow

### Input

- A url from Signal investors list

### Output

- A pandas dataframe with investors' `First Name`, `Last Name` and
  `Company Name`

## Usage

- Import the module using `import marketing.signal as mrksign`
- Select a list in https://signal.nfx.com/investor-lists/ and open its page
- The url for the list will work as a input data, for e.g.:
  `baseurl = https://signal.nfx.com/investor-lists/top-fintech-seed-investors`
- Determine the range of data to be extracted in a particular run by specifying
  the start index and the length of the data
  - This is because the page is only loading a few items for one click on the
    loading button and the total length of data is unknown. We don't want the
    code to run forever
- In any notebook, run the following script to get a pandas dataframe
  representing the specified data range of the list:

  ```python
  import marketing.signal as mrksign

  baseurl = <url_to_the_list>
  start_idx = <first_item_needed>
  length = <length_of_items_needed>
  signal_dataframe = mrksign.extract_investors_from_signal_url(baseurl, start_idx, length)

  ```
