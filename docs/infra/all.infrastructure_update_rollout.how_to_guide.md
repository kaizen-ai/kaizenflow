# Standardized Update Rollout Checklist

## Introduction

This document outlines a standardized procedure for testing, deploying, and
monitoring software updates across various environments. By following this
checklist, we aim to ensure that all updates are rolled out efficiently,
consistently, and safely.

## Checklist

### Phase 1: Planning

- [ ] **Issue Creation**:
  - File a GitHub issue detailing the purpose of the update, specific versions
    we plan to update, and the specific benefits we aim to achieve.

- [ ] **Identify Update Requirements**:
  - Determine which components need updates and the reasons (security updates,
    feature enhancements, bug fixes).

- [ ] **Review Update Documentation**:
  - Study the release notes and documentation of the updates to understand the
    changes, new features, new dependencies, breaking changes, and potential
    impacts.

- [ ] **Stakeholder Communication**:
  - Inform relevant stakeholders about the planned update and gather any initial
    feedback or concerns.

- [ ] **Schedule Rollout**:
  - Choose an appropriate time for the update rollout that minimizes impact on
    users.

### Phase 2: Testing

- [ ] **Environment Setup**:
  - Set up testing environments that closely mirror production systems.

- [ ] **Apply Updates**:
  - Deploy the updates in the testing environment.

- [ ] **Automated Testing**:
  - Run automated regression and new feature tests to ensure nothing breaks with
    the new updates.

- [ ] **Manual Testing**:
  - Conduct thorough manual testing to check for issues not covered by automated
    tests.

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**:
  - Compare performance metrics before and after the update to ensure no
    degradation.

- [ ] **Security Assessment**:
  - Perform security audits on the updated components to ensure no new
    vulnerabilities are introduced.

### Phase 3: Pre-Deployment

- [ ] **Final Review Meeting**:
  - Conduct a meeting with relevant stakeholders to review and decide whether to
    proceed with the deployment to production.

- [ ] **Backup Production Data**:
  - Ensure that all relevant production data is backed up and restore points are
    created.

- [ ] **Rollback Plan**:
  - Prepare detailed rollback procedures in case the update needs to be
    reversed. (Utilize Kubernetesâ€™ capabilities for a seamless rollback, which
    can be executed with minimal to no downtime.)

- [ ] **Stakeholder Announcement**:
  - Ensure all stakeholders are informed about the upcoming update and its
    implications. Issue a notification via Telegram and email detailing the
    scope of the update, deployment start time, and expected downtime duration
    if applicable, before the actual deployment to ensure sufficient preparation
    time.

### Phase 4: Deployment

- [ ] **Phased Rollout**:
  - If applicable, roll out the update incrementally (canary release, blue-green
    deployments).

- [ ] **Monitoring**:
  - Closely monitor the system for any immediate issues during and after the
    deployment.

- [ ] **Stakeholder Update**:
  - Keep stakeholders updated on the deployment status and any critical issues.

### Phase 5: Post-Deployment

- [ ] **Post-Deployment Testing and Monitoring**:
  - Conduct additional testing to ensure the system operates as expected in the
    production environment. Closely monitor the system after deployment for any
    unforeseen issues.

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Monitor system performance over time to catch any delayed effects of the
    update.

- [ ] **Issue Log**:
  - Document any issues encountered during deployment and how they were
    resolved.

- [ ] **Feedback Loop**:
  - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to assess the impact of the
    update.

## Conclusion

This checklist serves as a framework to guide the update process for software
and infrastructure within Kaizen. By adhering to these steps, we ensure that
updates are implemented smoothly, securely, and with minimal disruption.
